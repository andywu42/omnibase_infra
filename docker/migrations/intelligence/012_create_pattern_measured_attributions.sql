-- Migration: 012_create_pattern_measured_attributions
-- Description: Create pattern_measured_attributions table for attribution audit trail
-- Author: omniintelligence
-- Date: 2026-02-11
-- Ticket: OMN-2133
--
-- Dependencies: 005_create_learned_patterns.sql (pattern_id references learned_patterns)
-- Note: This table provides the audit trail for evidence-based attribution.
--       Each record captures a single attribution binding event: linking a session
--       outcome to a pipeline measurement run and computing the evidence tier.
--       The evidence_tier on learned_patterns is the denormalized projection;
--       this table is the source of truth for WHY that tier was assigned.
