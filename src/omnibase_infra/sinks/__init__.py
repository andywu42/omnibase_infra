"""Ledger sink implementations for runtime traceability.

Sink implementations for the ProtocolLedgerSink interface.
Sinks receive ledger events and handle durability, batching, and delivery.

Sinks:
    - InMemoryLedgerSink: Test-only in-memory buffer (NOT durable)
    - FileSpoolLedgerSink: Durable append-only JSONL with rotation

Usage:
    >>> from omnibase_infra.sinks import InMemoryLedgerSink, FileSpoolLedgerSink
    >>>
    >>> # For unit tests only
    >>> test_sink = InMemoryLedgerSink()
    >>>
    >>> # For production (durable)
    >>> production_sink = FileSpoolLedgerSink(
    ...     spool_dir="/var/log/omninode/ledger",
    ...     max_file_size_bytes=10 * 1024 * 1024,  # 10MB
    ... )

Security:
    Sinks write events as-is. Ensure event models exclude sensitive data
    (raw SQL, credentials, PII) before emission.
