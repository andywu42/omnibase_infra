"""Contract Projection Model.

Provides the Pydantic model for contract projections stored in PostgreSQL.
Used by the Registry API to query registered contracts and their metadata.

The contracts table stores registered ONEX contracts with full YAML content
for replay capability and Kafka position tracking for exactly-once semantics.

    """Contract projection for Registry API queries.

    Represents a registered ONEX contract stored in PostgreSQL. This model
    maps to the contracts table created by migration 005.

    Primary Key:
        contract_id - derived natural key: node_name:major.minor.patch

    Attributes:
        contract_id: Derived natural key (e.g., "my-node:1.0.0")
        node_name: ONEX node name from contract metadata
        version_major: Semantic version major component
        version_minor: Semantic version minor component
        version_patch: Semantic version patch component
        contract_hash: SHA-256 hash of contract YAML for change detection
        contract_yaml: Full contract YAML content for replay capability
        registered_at: Timestamp when contract was first registered
        deregistered_at: Timestamp when contract was deregistered (None if active)
        last_seen_at: Timestamp of most recent heartbeat or registration event
        is_active: Whether contract is currently active (soft delete)
        last_event_topic: Kafka topic of last processed event (for dedupe)
        last_event_partition: Kafka partition of last processed event (for dedupe)
        last_event_offset: Kafka offset of last processed event (for dedupe)
        created_at: Timestamp when row was created
        updated_at: Timestamp when row was last updated

        >>> from datetime import datetime, UTC
