"""Topic Projection Model.

Provides the Pydantic model for topic projections stored in PostgreSQL.
Used by the Registry API to query topic suffixes referenced by contracts
for routing discovery.

Topics use 5-segment naming (e.g., onex.evt.platform.contract-registered.v1)
and store SUFFIXES only - environment prefix is applied at runtime.

class ModelTopicProjection(BaseModel):
    """Topic projection for Registry API queries.

    Represents a topic suffix referenced by contracts for routing discovery.
    This model maps to the topics table created by migration 005.

    Primary Key:
        (topic_suffix, direction) - composite key allowing same topic with
        both publish and subscribe directions

    Topic Orphan Handling (OMN-1709):
        When all contracts referencing a topic are deregistered, the topic
        record remains with an empty contract_ids list. This is intentional:
        - Preserves topic routing history for auditing and debugging
        - Allows topic reactivation if a new contract references the same topic
        - Avoids complex cascading deletes during high-volume deregistration

    Attributes:
        topic_suffix: Topic suffix without environment prefix
        direction: Whether contracts publish to or subscribe from this topic
        contract_ids: List of contract_id strings that reference this topic
        first_seen_at: Timestamp when topic was first seen in any contract
        last_seen_at: Timestamp when topic was last seen in any contract
        is_active: Whether topic is currently referenced by any active contract
        created_at: Timestamp when row was created
        updated_at: Timestamp when row was last updated

    Example:
        >>> from datetime import datetime, UTC
        >>> now = datetime.now(UTC)
        >>> projection = ModelTopicProjection(
        ...     topic_suffix="onex.evt.platform.contract-registered.v1",
