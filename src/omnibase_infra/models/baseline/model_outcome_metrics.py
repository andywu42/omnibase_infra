    Note:
        ``total_checks``, ``passed_checks``, and ``failed_checks`` are
        independent counters with no consistency validation. Some test
        frameworks don't report a per-check breakdown, so enforcing
        ``total == passed + failed`` would reject valid partial data.

    Attributes:
        passed: Whether the run passed validation.
        total_checks: Total number of checks executed. Not enforced as
            passed + failed sum; partial reporting is supported.
        passed_checks: Number of checks that passed.
        failed_checks: Number of checks that failed.
        flake_rate: Flake rate as a fraction in [0.0, 1.0].
        review_iterations: Number of review iterations required.
