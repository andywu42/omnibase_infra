    Attributes:
        baseline_passed: Whether the baseline run passed.

        flake_rate_delta: Difference in flake rate (baseline - candidate).
            Positive means candidate had a lower flake rate.
        review_iteration_delta: Difference in review iterations
            (baseline - candidate).  Positive means candidate needed
            fewer iterations.
