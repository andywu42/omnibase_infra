"""Base model for ledger events.

The common envelope fields shared by all ledger events.
All ledger event types inherit from ModelLedgerEventBase.

Design Decisions:
    - Frozen models: Immutability for thread safety and hashability
    - Required envelope fields: Ensures traceability and deduplication
    - No raw SQL/params: Security constraint enforced by excluding such fields
    - Deterministic idempotency_key: Enables reconciliation on retries

    All ledger events share common envelope fields for traceability,
    correlation, and idempotency. Event-specific fields are added in subclasses.

    Attributes:
        event_type: Discriminator for event type (e.g., "db.query.requested").
        event_id: Unique identifier for this specific event emission.
        correlation_id: Distributed tracing ID linking related operations.
        causation_id: ID of the event/action that caused this event (optional).
        idempotency_key: Deterministic key for deduplication on retries.
            Format: "{correlation_id}:{operation_name}:{event_type}"
        contract_id: Identifier of the contract (e.g., repository name).
        contract_fingerprint: SHA256 hash of canonical contract JSON.
        operation_name: Name of the operation being traced.
        emitted_at: Timestamp when the event was emitted.

    Security:
        This model explicitly excludes raw SQL and unredacted parameters.
        Subclasses must not add fields that expose sensitive data.
