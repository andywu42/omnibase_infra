"""Topic catalog entry model.

Defines a single topic entry in the catalog response. Each entry contains
both the canonical topic suffix and the resolved topic name, along with
publisher/subscriber counts and computed active status.

Design Decisions:
    - D1: Both ``topic_suffix`` (canonical identity) and ``topic_name`` (resolved)
      are included in every entry for debugging and operational visibility.
    - D4: ``is_active`` is computed as ``publisher_count > 0 or subscriber_count > 0``
      and is never accepted as input. Enforced via ``@model_validator(mode="after")``.

    """Single topic entry in the catalog.

    Contains identity, metadata, and runtime state for one topic. The
    ``is_active`` field is always computed from publisher/subscriber counts
    and cannot be set directly.

    Attributes:
        topic_suffix: Canonical ONEX 5-segment topic suffix
            (e.g., ``onex.evt.platform.node-registration.v1``).
        topic_name: Resolved Kafka topic name including any tenant/namespace
            prefix.
        description: Human-readable description of the topic purpose.
        partitions: Number of partitions configured for this topic.
        publisher_count: Number of active publishers on this topic.
        subscriber_count: Number of active subscribers on this topic.
        is_active: Computed field: ``True`` if the topic has at least one
            publisher or subscriber. Never accepted as input.
        tags: Optional tags for categorization (e.g., ``("platform", "lifecycle")``).

    Example:
        >>> entry = ModelTopicCatalogEntry(
        ...     topic_suffix="onex.evt.platform.node-registration.v1",
