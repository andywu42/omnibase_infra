"""Wiring health metrics model for emission/consumption comparison.

The data model for aggregate wiring health status,
including per-topic health and overall system status.

Design Rationale:
    - Immutable (frozen=True) for thread-safety
    - Copy-on-write updates via factory methods
    - Threshold-based alert triggering
    - Prometheus metric exposure
