"""Wiring health monitoring for ONEX event bus.

Infrastructure for detecting silent partial wiring failures
by comparing message emission counts to consumption counts on critical feedback
loop topics.

Architecture:
    - MixinEmissionCounter: Counts messages published to EventBus
    - MixinConsumptionCounter: Counts messages successfully consumed
    - WiringHealthChecker: Computes mismatch ratios and emits alerts

Design Decisions:
    - Prometheus scrape is the scheduler (no background loop)
    - Only monitors WIRING_HEALTH_MONITORED_TOPICS (bounded memory)
    - Checker + health endpoint pattern (ONEX-aligned primitives)
    - 5% mismatch threshold accounts for at-least-once delivery
