"""Coroutine-safe consumption counter mixin for wiring health monitoring.

A mixin that tracks successful message consumption per-topic
for use in wiring health comparisons. It counts only configured topics and only
counts successful processing (not DLQ-routed messages).

Design Rationale:
    - Uses asyncio.Lock for coroutine-safe counter updates (not thread-safe)
    - Counts only topics in WIRING_HEALTH_MONITORED_TOPICS (bounded memory)
    - Only counts SUCCESSFUL consumption (after dispatch engine succeeds)
    - Does NOT count DLQ-routed messages (those are failures, not consumption)
    - Copy-on-write semantics for get_consumption_counts() (no lock held during read)

Usage:
    ```python
    from omnibase_infra.observability.wiring_health import MixinConsumptionCounter

    class EventBusSubcontractWiring(MixinConsumptionCounter):
        def __init__(self, ...):
            self._init_consumption_counter()
            # ... other init ...

        async def callback(message: ProtocolEventMessage) -> None:
            # ... dispatch to engine ...
            await self._dispatch_engine.dispatch(topic, envelope)
            # Success - record consumption
            await self._record_consumption(topic)
    ```

Concurrency Safety:
    Uses asyncio.Lock which provides coroutine-safe access within a single
    event loop. Not thread-safe. For multi-threaded usage, additional
    synchronization would be required.
