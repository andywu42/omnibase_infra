"""Coroutine-safe emission counter mixin for EventBus wiring health monitoring.

A mixin that tracks message emissions per-topic for use
in wiring health comparisons. It counts only configured topics to avoid
unbounded memory growth from tracking all possible topics.

Design Rationale:
    - Uses asyncio.Lock for coroutine-safe counter updates (not thread-safe)
    - Counts only topics in WIRING_HEALTH_MONITORED_TOPICS (bounded memory)
    - Copy-on-write semantics for get_emission_counts() (no lock held during read)
    - Counter reset capability for testing and periodic reset

Usage:
    ```python
    from omnibase_infra.observability.wiring_health import MixinEmissionCounter

    class EventBusKafka(MixinAsyncCircuitBreaker, MixinEmissionCounter):
        def __init__(self, config):
            self._init_emission_counter()
            # ... other init ...

        async def publish(self, topic: str, key: bytes | None, value: bytes) -> None:
            # ... publish logic ...
            await self._record_emission(topic)
    ```

Concurrency Safety:
    Uses asyncio.Lock which provides coroutine-safe access within a single
    event loop. Not thread-safe. For multi-threaded usage, additional
    synchronization would be required.
