"""Demo Reset -- scoped environment reset for safe pre-demo cleanup.

Provides a safe, scoped reset of demo-related infrastructure without
affecting shared resources. This module resets only demo-scoped resources:

1. **Consumer group offsets** -- Projector starts fresh on next run
2. **Projector state** -- Registration projection rows cleared
3. **Topic data** (optional) -- Clean slate for event monitor

Shared infrastructure is explicitly preserved:
- PostgreSQL table schemas and indexes
- Non-demo Kafka topics and consumer groups
- Consul/Vault configuration
- Application code and contracts

The reset is idempotent: running twice produces the same result.

Usage:
    CLI entry point::

        uv run omni-infra demo reset [--dry-run] [--purge-topics]

    Programmatic::

        from omnibase_infra.cli.service_demo_reset import DemoResetEngine

        engine = DemoResetEngine(config)
        report = await engine.execute(dry_run=True)
        print(report.format_summary())

    This replaces the previous pattern of creating a full ``asyncpg`` pool

    eliminates the leak that occurred when ``asyncio.wait_for`` timed out
    during ``asyncpg.create_pool()``: the partially-initialized pool was
    never closed.

    The connection is established inside ``__aenter__`` via
    ``asyncio.wait_for(asyncpg.connect(...), timeout=...)``.  If the
    timeout fires before ``asyncpg.connect()`` returns, the assignment to
    ``self._conn`` never occurs, so ``__aexit__`` sees ``None`` and skips
    cleanup.  This is safe because ``asyncio.wait_for`` cancels the
    wrapped coroutine on timeout, and asyncpg internally closes any
    underlying socket resources when the coroutine is cancelled.
    ``__aexit__`` only closes connections that were successfully

class DemoResetEngine:
    """Scoped demo reset engine.

    Executes a series of reset operations on demo-scoped resources
    while explicitly preserving shared infrastructure.

    The engine is designed to be:
    - **Safe**: Only demo-scoped resources are affected
    - **Idempotent**: Running twice produces the same result
    - **Observable**: Every action is reported with detail
    - **Reversible**: Topic purge is the only destructive operation

    Note:
        The Kafka consumer group and topic operations use
        ``confluent-kafka``'s ``AdminClient``, which performs blocking I/O
        internally.  This is acceptable for CLI use where ``execute()``
        is invoked via ``asyncio.run()`` and the event loop is otherwise
        idle, but the engine **must not** be used within an event loop
        that serves concurrent requests (e.g. a FastAPI endpoint) because
        the blocking calls would stall the loop.

    Example:
        >>> config = ModelDemoResetConfig.from_env(purge_topics=False)
