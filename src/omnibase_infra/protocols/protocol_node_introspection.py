"""Node Introspection Protocol.

The protocol interface for node introspection,
enabling typed dependency injection for auto-introspection on node startup.

The protocol is designed to work with existing infrastructure:
    - MixinNodeIntrospection provides the concrete implementation
    - RuntimeHostProcess accepts this protocol for startup introspection
    - EnumIntrospectionReason categorizes introspection events

Thread Safety:
    Implementations of ProtocolNodeIntrospection MUST be thread-safe for
    concurrent async calls. Multiple coroutines may invoke publish methods
    simultaneously during runtime lifecycle events.

    """Protocol for node introspection services.

    This protocol defines the interface required for auto-introspection
    functionality in RuntimeHostProcess. Implementations enable nodes to
    announce their presence on startup with configurable jitter and throttling.

    Thread Safety:
        Implementations MUST be thread-safe for concurrent async calls.

        **Guarantees implementers MUST provide:**
            - Concurrent calls to publish methods are safe
            - Heartbeat task management is thread-safe
            - Internal state is protected by appropriate locks

    Note:
        Method bodies in this Protocol use ``...`` (Ellipsis) rather than
        ``raise NotImplementedError()``. This is the standard Python convention
        for ``typing.Protocol`` classes per PEP 544.

    Example:
        >>> class MyIntrospectionService:
        ...     async def publish_introspection(
        ...         self,
        ...         reason: EnumIntrospectionReason,
        ...         correlation_id: UUID | None = None,
        ...     ) -> None:
        ...         # Publish introspection event to Kafka
        ...         ...
        ...
        ...     async def start_heartbeat_task(self) -> None:
        ...         # Start periodic heartbeat publishing
        ...         ...
        ...
        ...     async def stop_heartbeat_task(self) -> None:
        ...         # Stop heartbeat task gracefully
        ...         ...

    See Also:
        - MixinNodeIntrospection: Provides publish_introspection implementation
        - RuntimeHostProcess: Consumer of this protocol for startup introspection
        - ModelRuntimeIntrospectionConfig: Configuration for timing parameters

        Thread Safety:
