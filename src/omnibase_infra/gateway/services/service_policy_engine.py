"""Policy Engine Service for Runtime Gateway.

A policy engine for evaluating message filtering rules
in the ONEX runtime gateway. The engine supports:

- Topic allowlist checking with wildcard patterns
- Realm boundary enforcement to prevent cross-realm messages
- Extensible policy evaluation for inbound/outbound messages

The policy engine is designed to be lightweight and fast, suitable for
high-throughput message processing pipelines.

Design Decisions:
    - Empty allowlist means "allow all" for operational simplicity
    - Wildcard patterns use simple prefix/suffix matching (not regex)
    - Rejections are logged by default for security audit trails
    - All policy decisions include a reason for debugging

Security Considerations:
    - Topic allowlists should be loaded from trusted configuration
    - Realm enforcement prevents tenant isolation violations
    - All rejections are logged with full context for audit

Example:
    >>> from omnibase_infra.gateway.services import (
    ...     ServicePolicyEngine,
    ...     EnumPolicyDecision,
    ... )
    >>> engine = ServicePolicyEngine(
    ...     allowed_topics=["events.*", "commands.user.*"],
    ...     expected_realm="tenant-123",
    ... )
    >>> decision = engine.evaluate_inbound("events.order.created", realm="tenant-123")
    >>> assert decision.decision == EnumPolicyDecision.ALLOW
