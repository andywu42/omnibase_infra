"""Database ownership validation utility.

Validates that the connected database is owned by the expected service by
querying the ``public.db_metadata`` singleton table. Used during kernel
startup to prevent cross-service data corruption after the DB-per-repo split.

    Queries ``public.db_metadata`` for the singleton ownership row and compares
    ``owner_service`` against ``expected_owner``. Raises on mismatch or missing
    data -- the kernel catches these typed errors and hard-fails.

    Args:
        pool: asyncpg connection pool (must already be created).
        expected_owner: Service name that should own this database
            (e.g. ``"omnibase_infra"``). Must be a non-empty, non-whitespace
            string.
        correlation_id: Optional correlation ID for tracing. Auto-generated
            if not provided.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``expected_owner`` is empty or whitespace-only.
        DbOwnershipMismatchError: Database is owned by a different service.
