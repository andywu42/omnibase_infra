"""ModelProjectionResultLocal — local stub until OMN-2508 (omnibase_spi) merges.

OMN-2508 will implement NodeProjectionEffect in omnibase_spi, which includes
a ``ModelProjectionResult`` (success/failure with artifact_ref).  Until that
PR lands and the new omnibase-spi package is published, the runtime uses this
local stub so the pipeline can be fully wired and tested.

Migration path (OMN-2510 follow-up):
    Once omnibase_spi>=0.11.0 exposes ModelProjectionResult, delete this file
    and update all imports to the canonical location from omnibase_spi.

Note:
    Do not confuse this with ``omnibase_core.models.projectors.ModelProjectionResult``
    which tracks per-row SQL projection outcomes.  This local model tracks the
    higher-level effect result: did the synchronous projection effect succeed
    and where is the artifact?
