"""Event bus subcontract wiring for contract-driven Kafka subscriptions.

The bridge between contract-declared topics (from the
`event_bus` subcontract) and actual Kafka subscriptions. The runtime owns
all Kafka plumbing - nodes/handlers never create consumers or producers directly.

Architecture:
    The EventBusSubcontractWiring class is responsible for:
    1. Reading `subscribe_topics` from ModelEventBusSubcontract
    2. Passing topic suffixes through unchanged (topics are realm-agnostic)
    3. Creating Kafka subscriptions with appropriate consumer groups
    4. Bridging received messages to the MessageDispatchEngine
    5. Managing subscription lifecycle (creation and cleanup)
    6. Classifying errors as content vs infrastructure for proper handling

    This follows the ARCH-002 principle: "Runtime owns all Kafka plumbing."
    Nodes and handlers declare their topic requirements in contracts, but
    never directly interact with Kafka consumers or producers.

Error Classification:
    The wiring distinguishes between two error categories:

    Content Errors (non-retryable):
        Schema validation failures, malformed payloads, missing required fields,
        type conversion errors. These will NOT fix themselves with retry.
        Default behavior: Send to DLQ and commit offset (dlq_and_commit).
        Identified by: ProtocolConfigurationError, json.JSONDecodeError,
        pydantic.ValidationError

    Infrastructure Errors (potentially retryable):
        Database timeouts, network failures, service unavailability.
        These errors MAY fix themselves after retry.
        Default behavior: Fail fast (fail_fast) to avoid hiding infrastructure
        fires in the DLQ.
        Identified by: RuntimeHostError and subclasses (InfraConnectionError,
        InfraTimeoutError, InfraUnavailableError, etc.)

DLQ Consumer Group Alignment:
    IMPORTANT: The consumer_group used for DLQ publishing MUST match the
    consumer_group used when subscribing to topics. This is critical for:
    - Traceability: DLQ messages can be correlated back to their source consumer
    - Replay operations: DLQ replay tools can identify which consumer group failed
    - Debugging: Operations teams can trace failures to specific consumer groups

    The wiring ensures this alignment by:
    1. Computing consumer_group as "{environment}.{node_name}" in wire_subscriptions
    2. Passing this same consumer_group to _create_dispatch_callback
    3. Using it in all _publish_to_dlq calls within the callback closure

Topic Resolution:
    Topics are realm-agnostic and do NOT include environment prefixes.
    The environment/realm is a routing boundary enforced via envelope identity,
    not a topic prefix. This enables cross-environment event routing when needed.

    Topic suffixes from contracts follow the ONEX naming convention:
        onex.{kind}.{producer}.{event-name}.v{n}

    The wiring passes these topic suffixes through unchanged:
        onex.{kind}.{producer}.{event-name}.v{n}

    Example:
        - Contract declares: "onex.evt.omniintelligence.intent-classified.v1"
        - Resolved: "onex.evt.omniintelligence.intent-classified.v1"

    Note: Consumer groups still include environment for isolation.

class EventBusSubcontractWiring(MixinConsumptionCounter):
    """Wires event_bus subcontracts to Kafka subscriptions and publishers.

    This class bridges contract-declared topics to actual Kafka subscriptions,
    ensuring that nodes/handlers never directly interact with Kafka infrastructure.
    The runtime owns all Kafka plumbing per ARCH-002.

    Responsibilities:
        - Parse subscribe_topics from ModelEventBusSubcontract
        - Pass topic suffixes through unchanged (topics are realm-agnostic)
        - Create Kafka subscriptions with appropriate consumer groups
        - Deserialize incoming messages to ModelEventEnvelope
        - Check idempotency and skip duplicate messages (if enabled)
        - Classify errors as content (DLQ) vs infrastructure (fail-fast)
        - Dispatch envelopes to MessageDispatchEngine
        - Manage subscription lifecycle (cleanup on shutdown)

    Error Classification:
        Content Errors (non-retryable): ProtocolConfigurationError, ValidationError,
        json.JSONDecodeError. Default: DLQ and commit offset.

        Infrastructure Errors (retryable): RuntimeHostError and subclasses.
        Default: Fail-fast (no DLQ, no commit).

    Idempotency:
        When configured with an idempotency store and enabled config, the wiring
        deduplicates messages based on the `envelope_id` field from the envelope.
        Messages with the same envelope_id (within a topic domain) are processed
        only once - duplicates are logged and skipped.

        Requirements when idempotency is enabled:
        - All envelopes MUST have a non-None envelope_id field
        - Missing envelope_id raises ProtocolConfigurationError

    Thread Safety:
        This class is designed for single-threaded async use. All subscription
        operations should be performed from a single async context. The underlying
        event bus implementations (EventBusKafka, EventBusInmemory) handle their
        own thread safety for message delivery.
