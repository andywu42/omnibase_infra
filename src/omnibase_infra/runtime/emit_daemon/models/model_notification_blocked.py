"""Notification Blocked Event Model.

This model represents a notification event emitted when an agent is blocked
waiting for human input during ticket work execution.

Design:
    - Event payload for `notification.blocked` event type
    - Published to Kafka by the emit daemon in omniclaude3
    - Consumed by notification consumer and routed to Slack

Example Payload:
    ```json
    {
        "ticket_identifier": "OMN-1234",
        "reason": "Waiting for specification approval",
        "details": ["Phase: spec", "Gate: approve spec"],
        "repo": "omniclaude",
        "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    }
    ```
