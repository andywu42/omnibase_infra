"""Notification Completed Event Model.

This model represents a notification event emitted when ticket work is
completed successfully.

Design:
    - Event payload for `notification.completed` event type
    - Published to Kafka by the emit daemon in omniclaude3
    - Consumed by notification consumer and routed to Slack

Example Payload:
    ```json
    {
        "ticket_identifier": "OMN-1234",
        "summary": "Implemented dark mode feature",
        "repo": "omniclaude",
        "pr_url": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123",
        "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    }
    ```
