"""Topic-scoped publisher that validates against contract-declared publish topics.

A publisher that enforces topic-level access control
based on the contract's `event_bus.publish_topics` section. Handlers can only
publish to topics explicitly declared in their contract, preventing unauthorized
event emission and maintaining clean architectural boundaries.

Design Principles:
    - **Contract-Driven Access Control**: Topics must be declared in contract
    - **Realm-Agnostic Topics**: Topics passed through unchanged (no env prefix)
    - **Fail-Fast Validation**: Invalid topics raise immediately, not at delivery
    - **Duck-Typed Protocol**: Implements publisher protocol without explicit inheritance

Architecture Context:
    In the ONEX handler architecture, each handler receives a topic-scoped
    publisher configured with only the topics from its contract. This ensures:

    1. Handlers cannot publish to arbitrary topics
    2. Topic dependencies are explicit and auditable
    3. Contract changes required to add new publish targets
    4. Clear separation between handler capabilities

Example Usage:
    ```python
    from omnibase_infra.runtime.publisher_topic_scoped import PublisherTopicScoped
    from omnibase_infra.event_bus.event_bus_kafka import EventBusKafka

    # Create topic-scoped publisher from contract
    publisher = PublisherTopicScoped(
        event_bus=kafka_event_bus,
        allowed_topics={"onex.fsm.state.transitions.v1", "onex.events.v1"},
        environment="dev",
    )

    # Publish to allowed topic (succeeds)
    await publisher.publish(
        event_type="state.transition",
        payload={"from": "pending", "to": "active"},
        topic="onex.fsm.state.transitions.v1",
        correlation_id="abc-123",
    )

    # Publish to disallowed topic (raises ProtocolConfigurationError)
    await publisher.publish(
        event_type="audit.log",
        payload={"action": "login"},
        topic="onex.audit.v1",  # Not in allowed_topics
        correlation_id="xyz-789",
    )
    # ProtocolConfigurationError: Topic 'onex.audit.v1' not in contract's publish_topics.
    #                             Allowed: ['onex.events.v1', 'onex.fsm.state.transitions.v1']
    ```

Thread Safety:
    This class is coroutine-safe for concurrent async publishing. The underlying
    event bus handles synchronization. No mutable state is shared between
    publish operations.

    This publisher ensures handlers can only publish to topics explicitly

    Features:
        - Contract-driven topic access control
        - Realm-agnostic topics (no environment prefix)
