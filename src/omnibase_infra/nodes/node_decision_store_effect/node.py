"""NodeDecisionStoreEffect — declarative effect node for decision store writes.

This node follows the ONEX declarative pattern:
    - DECLARATIVE effect driven by contract.yaml
    - Zero custom routing logic — all behavior from handler_routing
    - Lightweight shell that delegates to handlers via container resolution
    - Used for ONEX-compliant runtime execution via RuntimeHostProcess
    - Pattern: "Contract-driven, handlers wired externally"

Extends NodeEffect from omnibase_core for infrastructure I/O operations.
All handler routing is 100% driven by contract.yaml, not Python code.

Handler Routing Pattern:
    1. Receive intent with typed payload (write_decision or write_conflict)
    2. Route to appropriate handler based on payload.intent_type
    3. Execute PostgreSQL I/O via handler (two-stage for write_decision)
    4. Return structured ModelBackendResult

Design Decisions:
    - 100% Contract-Driven: All routing logic in YAML, not Python
    - Zero Custom Routing: Base class handles handler dispatch via contract
    - Two-Stage Isolation: Stage 1 commits independently; Stage 2 is best-effort
    - Container DI: Pool resolved via container, not setter methods

Supported Intent Types:
    - decision_store.write_decision: Two-stage upsert + conflict detection
    - decision_store.write_conflict: Idempotent conflict-pair insert
