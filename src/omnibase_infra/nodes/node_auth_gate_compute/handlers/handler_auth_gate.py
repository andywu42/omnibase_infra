"""Handler for auth gate — 10-step authorization decision cascade.

Pure COMPUTE handler: receives auth state + tool request, returns
allow/deny/soft_deny. No I/O, no side effects.

Decision Cascade (evaluated top-to-bottom, first match wins):
     1. Whitelisted paths -> allow (plans, memory)
     2. Emergency override active -> soft_deny (with banner) / deny if no reason
     3. No run_id determinable -> deny
     4. Run context not found (no authorization) -> deny
     5. Auth not granted (authorization exists but run_id mismatch) -> deny
     6. Tool not in allowed_tools -> deny
     7. Path not matching allowed_paths glob -> deny
     8. Repo not in repo_scopes -> deny
     9. Auth expired -> deny
    10. All checks pass -> allow

        """Convert a glob pattern (supporting ``**``) to a compiled regex.

        Standard ``fnmatch`` does not treat ``**`` as recursive directory
        match. This function converts glob patterns to regex where:
        - ``**`` matches zero or more path components (including ``/``)
        - ``*`` matches any characters except ``/``
        - ``?`` matches a single non-``/`` character

        Note:
            ``**`` is recognized anywhere two consecutive ``*`` appear, without
            verifying they are at a path boundary. Patterns like ``foo**/bar``
            would be treated as double-star glob. All patterns in the codebase
            use proper glob syntax (e.g., ``src/**/*.py``).

        Security:
            Patterns with more than ``_MAX_DOUBLE_STAR_SEGMENTS`` (2) ``**``
            segments are rejected with a ``ValueError`` to prevent ReDoS from
            catastrophic backtracking in the generated regex.

        Trust boundary:
            This method is cached with ``lru_cache(maxsize=128)``.  Patterns
            **must** originate from trusted contract configuration (i.e.
            ``ModelContractWorkAuthorization.allowed_paths``), never from
            end-user input.  Untrusted patterns could fill the cache with
            adversarial entries, evicting legitimate compiled regexes.

        Args:
            pattern: Glob pattern, e.g. ``src/**/*.py``.

        Returns:
            Compiled regex pattern.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the pattern contains more than
                ``_MAX_DOUBLE_STAR_SEGMENTS`` ``**`` segments.
