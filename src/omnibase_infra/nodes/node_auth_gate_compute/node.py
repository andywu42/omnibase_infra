"""NodeAuthGateCompute - Declarative COMPUTE node for authorization decisions.

Pure COMPUTE node that evaluates a 10-step authorization cascade.
Receives auth state + tool request, returns allow/deny/soft_deny.
No I/O — all business logic is delegated to HandlerAuthGate per ONEX
declarative node pattern.

Design Rationale:
    ONEX nodes are declarative shells driven by contract.yaml. The node class
    extends the appropriate archetype base class and contains no custom logic.
    All compute behavior is defined in handlers configured via handler_routing
    in the contract.

Ticket: OMN-2125
