    """Output contract for the bifrost LLM gateway handler.

    Every routing decision produces a ``ModelBifrostResponse``. The
    ``backend_selected``, ``matched_rule_id``, ``latency_ms``, and
    ``retry_count`` fields form the auditable routing log required by
    OMN-2736 requirement R2.

    Attributes:
        backend_selected: ID of the backend that served the request.
            Corresponds to a ``backend_id`` in ``ModelBifrostConfig``.
        matched_rule_id: UUID of the routing rule that matched the
            request. ``None`` when the fallback default backend list was
            used or no backends were available.
        latency_ms: End-to-end gateway latency in milliseconds,
            measured from rule evaluation to response receipt.
        retry_count: Number of backends attempted before success.
            0 means the first backend succeeded; N means N backends
            were tried before a successful response.
        tenant_id: Caller identity UUID copied from the request for
            audit log queryability.
        correlation_id: Correlation ID UUID for distributed tracing.
        inference_response: The underlying LLM inference response
            from the selected backend. None when all backends failed
            and ``success=False``.
        success: Whether the request was served successfully.
        error_message: Structured error description when ``success``
            is False. Empty string on success.

    Example:
        >>> from uuid import UUID
        >>> resp = ModelBifrostResponse(
        ...     backend_selected="qwen-14b",
        ...     matched_rule_id=UUID("abcdefab-cdef-abcd-efab-cdefabcdefab"),
        ...     latency_ms=342.5,
        ...     retry_count=0,
        ...     tenant_id=UUID("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"),
        ...     correlation_id=UUID("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002"),
