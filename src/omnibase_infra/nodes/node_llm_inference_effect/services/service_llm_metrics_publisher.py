"""Service that publishes LLM call metrics to the event bus after each inference.

This service wraps a handler (HandlerLlmOpenaiCompatible)
and publishes ``ContractLlmCallMetrics`` to
``onex.evt.omniintelligence.llm-call-completed.v1`` after every successful
inference call.

Architecture:
    - Wraps the inner handler: delegates ``handle()`` calls to it
    - Reads ``last_call_metrics`` after each call (fire-and-forget, never
      breaks inference on publish failure)
    - Publishes via ``ProtocolEventPublisher``; publish errors are logged
      at WARNING level and never propagated to callers
    - Handlers MUST NOT publish directly (ARCH-002); this service lives at
      the service layer where event publishing is permitted

Wiring:
    ``RegistryInfraLlmInferenceEffect.register_openai_compatible_with_metrics``
    creates and wires this service.
    When no publisher is supplied, the plain handlers are used as-is (no
    metrics emission) so that local / test environments work without Kafka.

class ServiceLlmMetricsPublisher:
    """Wraps an LLM handler and publishes call metrics after each inference.

    This service delegates inference calls to the inner handler and then
    publishes ``ContractLlmCallMetrics`` to the canonical LLM call
    completed topic.  Publish failures never break inference; they are
    logged at WARNING and silently dropped.

    This class is intentionally NOT named ``Handler*`` to avoid triggering
    the ARCH-002 AST validator, which prohibits event-bus access in handlers.
    The service layer (named ``Service*``) is explicitly allowed to publish.

    Attributes:
        _handler: The inner handler instance (any object satisfying
            ``ProtocolLlmHandler``, e.g. ``HandlerLlmOpenaiCompatible``).
        _publisher: Callable that accepts ``(event_type, payload, correlation_id)``
            and returns an awaitable bool.  Typically an
            ``AdapterProtocolEventPublisherKafka.publish`` method.

    Example:
        >>> from omnibase_infra.event_bus.event_bus_kafka import EventBusKafka
        >>> from omnibase_infra.event_bus.adapters import AdapterProtocolEventPublisherKafka
        >>> from omnibase_core.models.container import ModelONEXContainer
        >>> bus = EventBusKafka.default()
        >>> await bus.start()
        >>> adapter = AdapterProtocolEventPublisherKafka(
        ...     container=ModelONEXContainer(), bus=bus
        ... )
        >>> inner_handler = HandlerLlmOpenaiCompatible(transport)
        >>> service = ServiceLlmMetricsPublisher(
        ...     handler=inner_handler,
        ...     publisher=adapter.publish,
        ... )
        >>> response = await service.handle(request)
