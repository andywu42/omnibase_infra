"""Node Pattern Lifecycle Effect -- updates pattern lifecycle tiers.

This effect node owns ALL lifecycle tier state transitions for validated
patterns.  It applies validation verdicts to promote, demote, or suppress
patterns according to the lifecycle tier progression:

    OBSERVED -> SUGGESTED -> SHADOW_APPLY -> PROMOTED -> DEFAULT

Auto-rollback rules:
    - 2 consecutive FAIL verdicts: demote one tier
    - 3 consecutive FAIL verdicts: suppress the pattern

Follows the ONEX declarative pattern:
    - DECLARATIVE effect driven by contract.yaml
    - Zero custom logic -- all behavior from handlers
    - Lightweight shell that delegates to handler implementations

Handlers:
    - HandlerLifecycleUpdate: Apply verdict and compute tier transition

Design Decisions:
    - Lifecycle state is immutable (frozen Pydantic) with copy-on-write
    - Tier transitions are deterministic from (current_state, verdict)
    - No external I/O in MVP -- state is passed in and returned

    - handlers/: Lifecycle update handler implementation
