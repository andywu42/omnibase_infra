"""Declarative EFFECT node for the Contract Resolver Bridge.

Exposes NodeContractResolveCompute (OMN-2754) via synchronous HTTP so the
dashboard can resolve overlaid contracts without a Kafka round-trip. Registered
identically to the production node — only the execution path changes when the
real ONEX node runner supports HTTP invocation.

Architecture
------------
Pure declarative shell — ``node.py`` contains NO custom business logic.
All configuration lives in ``contract.yaml`` (see ``config:`` section).
The FastAPI service lives in ``services/contract_resolver/``.

Ticket: OMN-2756
