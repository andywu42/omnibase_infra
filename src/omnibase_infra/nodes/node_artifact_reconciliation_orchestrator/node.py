"""NodeArtifactReconciliationOrchestrator — declarative ORCHESTRATOR.

Coordinates the artifact reconciliation pipeline: receives update plans,
posts PR comments, and emits YAML plan events.

All behavior is defined in contract.yaml — no custom logic here.

This orchestrator follows the ONEX declarative pattern:
    - DECLARATIVE orchestrator driven by contract.yaml
    - Zero custom routing logic — all behavior from workflow_definition
    - Used for ONEX-compliant runtime execution via RuntimeHostProcess
    - Pattern: "Contract-driven, handlers wired by registry"

Workflow Pattern:
    1. Receive ModelUpdatePlan (from update-plan-created event)
    2. Post PR comment via HandlerPlanToPRComment (for PR triggers only)
    3. Emit YAML plan via HandlerPlanToYaml

Handler Routing:
    Handler routing is defined declaratively in contract.yaml under
    handler_routing section. The orchestrator does NOT contain custom
    dispatch logic — the base class routes events based on:
    - routing_strategy: "payload_type_match"
    - handlers: mapping of event_model to handler_class

Design Decisions:
    - 100% Contract-Driven: All workflow logic in YAML, not Python
    - Zero Custom Methods: Base class handles everything
    - Declarative Execution: Workflow steps defined in execution_graph
    - No Filesystem Writes: HandlerPlanToYaml emits events, not files

Tracking:
    - OMN-3944: Task 7 — Reconciliation ORCHESTRATOR Node
    - OMN-3925: Artifact Reconciliation + Update Planning MVP
