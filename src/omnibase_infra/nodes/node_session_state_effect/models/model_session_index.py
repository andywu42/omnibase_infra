"""Session index model — maps to ``~/.claude/state/session.json``.

The session index is the central pointer that tracks which runs exist
and which (if any) is the active interactive run. It is protected by
``flock`` during writes to handle concurrent pipeline access.

Concurrency model:
    - ``recent_run_ids`` is append-only (new runs are prepended).
    - ``active_run_id`` is advisory for interactive sessions.
    - Multiple concurrent active runs are allowed — destructive ops
      are denied until ``/onex:set-active-run {run_id}`` disambiguates.
