"""Result model for NodeDecisionStoreQueryCompute.

Defines the paginated result returned by cursor-based decision store queries,
including next_cursor for page continuation and total_active for count display.

Note on ModelDecisionStoreEntry dependency:
    ModelDecisionStoreEntry is defined in omnibase_core (OMN-2763, PR #562),
    which is not yet released. The decisions field uses Any at runtime and is
    typed as tuple[ModelDecisionStoreEntry, ...] for static analysis only.
    Once OMN-2763 is merged, this model can be tightened to use the concrete type.

    """Paginated result of a decision store query.

    Attributes:
        decisions: Ordered tuple of matching decision entries for this page,
            sorted by (created_at DESC, decision_id DESC).
            Elements are ModelDecisionStoreEntry instances at runtime once
            OMN-2763 (omnibase_core) is merged.
        next_cursor: Opaque base64-encoded cursor for retrieving the next page.
            None when there are no further results (last page or empty result).
        total_active: Total count of decisions matching the same WHERE clause,
            computed without LIMIT. Useful for pagination UI ("N of M results").

    Notes:
        - next_cursor is None when len(decisions) < limit (last or only page).
        - total_active reflects the same filters as the query, not just this page.
        - decisions is an empty tuple when no results match the filter.
        - decisions uses Any element type pending OMN-2763 merge.
