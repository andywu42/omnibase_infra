class ModelPayloadQueryDecisions(BaseModel):
    """Filter parameters for querying decisions from the decision store.

    Supports cursor-based pagination and flexible scope filtering.
    All filter fields are optional; omitted fields are not applied.

    Attributes:
        domain: Filter by scope_domain (exact match).
        layer: Filter by scope_layer (exact match).
        decision_type: Filter by one or more decision_type values (OR semantics).
        tags: Filter decisions that have ALL of these tags.
        epic_id: Filter by epic_id (exact match).
        status: Filter by lifecycle status. Defaults to "ACTIVE".
        scope_services: List of service slugs to filter by.
            Empty list or None means "do not filter by services".
        scope_services_mode: How scope_services filter is applied.
            ANY — entry overlaps with filter list (at least one match).
            ALL — entry contains all filter services (superset).
            EXACT — entry's scope_services exactly equals filter set.
            Ignored when scope_services is None or empty.
        cursor: Opaque pagination cursor from a previous result's
            next_cursor field. Encodes base64(created_at_iso|decision_id).
        limit: Maximum number of results to return. Defaults to 50.

    Notes:
        - scope_services=None or scope_services=[] returns all decisions
          including platform-wide ones (empty scope_services in DB).
        - cursor ordering is: created_at DESC, decision_id DESC.
        - next_cursor is None when there are no further results.
