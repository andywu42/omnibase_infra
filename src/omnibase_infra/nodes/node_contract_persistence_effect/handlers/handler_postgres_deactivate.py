"""Handler for PostgreSQL contract deactivation (soft-delete).

This handler encapsulates PostgreSQL-specific deactivation logic for the
NodeContractPersistenceEffect node, following the declarative node pattern where
handlers are extracted for testability and separation of concerns.

Architecture:
    HandlerPostgresDeactivate is responsible for:
    - Executing soft-delete operations against PostgreSQL
    - Returning structured ModelBackendResult

    Timing, error classification, and sanitization are delegated to
    MixinPostgresOpExecutor to eliminate boilerplate drift across handlers.

    The deactivation operation performs a soft delete by marking the contract
    record as inactive (is_active=FALSE) and setting deregistered_at timestamp,
    preserving historical data for auditing.

Coroutine Safety:
    This handler is stateless and coroutine-safe for concurrent calls
    with different request instances. Thread-safety depends on the
    underlying asyncpg.Pool implementation.

class HandlerPostgresDeactivate(MixinPostgresOpExecutor):
    """Handler for PostgreSQL contract deactivation (soft-delete).

    Encapsulates all PostgreSQL-specific deactivation logic extracted from
    NodeContractPersistenceEffect for declarative node compliance.

    Timing, error classification, and sanitization are handled by the
    MixinPostgresOpExecutor base class, reducing boilerplate and ensuring
    consistent error handling across all PostgreSQL handlers.

    The deactivation operation marks a contract as inactive (soft delete)
    rather than performing a hard delete, preserving audit trails and enabling
    potential reactivation.

    Attributes:
        _pool: asyncpg connection pool for database operations.

    Example:
        >>> import asyncpg
        >>> pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(dsn="postgresql://...")
        >>> handler = HandlerPostgresDeactivate(pool)
        >>> result = await handler.handle(payload, correlation_id)
