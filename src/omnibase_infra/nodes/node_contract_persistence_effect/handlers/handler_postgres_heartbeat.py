"""Handler for updating contract heartbeat timestamp.

This handler encapsulates PostgreSQL-specific heartbeat update logic for the
NodeContractPersistenceEffect node, following the declarative node pattern where
handlers are extracted for testability and separation of concerns.

Architecture:
    HandlerPostgresHeartbeat is responsible for:
    - Executing heartbeat timestamp updates against PostgreSQL
    - Tracking whether the target row was found
    - Returning structured ModelBackendResult

    Timing, error classification, and sanitization are delegated to
    MixinPostgresOpExecutor to eliminate boilerplate drift across handlers.

Operation:
    Updates the last_seen_at timestamp for an active contract identified
    by contract_id. Only active contracts (is_active = TRUE) are updated.
    If the contract is not found or is inactive, the operation succeeds
    but row_found is logged as false.

SQL:
    UPDATE contracts
    SET last_seen_at = $1
    WHERE contract_id = $2 AND is_active = TRUE

Coroutine Safety:
    This handler is stateless and coroutine-safe for concurrent calls
    with different payload instances. Thread-safety depends on the
    underlying asyncpg.Pool implementation.

    """Handler for updating contract heartbeat timestamp.

    Encapsulates PostgreSQL-specific heartbeat update logic extracted from
    NodeContractPersistenceEffect for declarative node compliance. The handler
    provides a clean interface for executing timestamp updates.

    Timing, error classification, and sanitization are handled by the
    MixinPostgresOpExecutor base class, reducing boilerplate and ensuring
    consistent error handling across all PostgreSQL handlers.

    The heartbeat operation updates the last_seen_at timestamp for an active
    contract, supporting contract lifecycle management by tracking node
    liveness.

    Attributes:
        _pool: asyncpg connection pool for database operations.

    Example:
        >>> from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock
        >>> conn = MagicMock()
        >>> conn.execute = AsyncMock(return_value="UPDATE 1")
        >>> pool = MagicMock()
        >>> pool.acquire = MagicMock(return_value=AsyncContextManager(conn))
        >>> handler = HandlerPostgresHeartbeat(pool)
        >>> payload = MagicMock(
        ...     contract_id="my-node:1.0.0",
        ...     last_seen_at=datetime.now(),
        ... )
        >>> result = await handler.handle(payload, uuid4())
        >>> result.success
