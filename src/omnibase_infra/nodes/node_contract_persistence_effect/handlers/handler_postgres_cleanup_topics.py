"""Handler for PostgreSQL topic reference cleanup.

This handler encapsulates PostgreSQL-specific topic cleanup logic for the
NodeContractPersistenceEffect node, following the declarative node pattern where
handlers are extracted for testability and separation of concerns.

Architecture:
    HandlerPostgresCleanupTopics is responsible for:
    - Removing contract_id from topics.contract_ids JSONB arrays
    - Returning structured ModelBackendResult

    Timing, error classification, and sanitization are delegated to
    MixinPostgresOpExecutor to eliminate boilerplate drift across handlers.

    This handler removes a contract_id from the contract_ids JSONB array in
    all topics that reference it. Topic rows are NOT deleted even when the
    contract_ids array becomes empty.

Topic Orphan Handling (OMN-1709):
    When all contracts are removed from a topic, the topic row remains with
    empty contract_ids array. This is intentional:
    - Preserves topic routing history for auditing and debugging
    - Allows topic reactivation if a new contract references the same topic
    - Avoids complex cascading deletes during high-volume deregistration

    To clean up orphaned topics, run:
        DELETE FROM topics WHERE contract_ids = '[]' AND is_active = FALSE;

Coroutine Safety:
    This handler is stateless and coroutine-safe for concurrent calls
    with different request instances. Thread-safety depends on the
    underlying asyncpg.Pool implementation.

    """Handler for removing contract references from topics.

    Encapsulates all PostgreSQL-specific topic cleanup logic extracted from
    NodeContractPersistenceEffect for declarative node compliance.

    Timing, error classification, and sanitization are handled by the
    MixinPostgresOpExecutor base class, reducing boilerplate and ensuring
    consistent error handling across all PostgreSQL handlers.

    Important: Topic rows are NOT deleted even when contract_ids becomes empty.
    This is intentional per OMN-1709 - orphaned topics are preserved for
    auditing and can be cleaned up separately if needed.

    Attributes:
        _pool: asyncpg connection pool for database operations.

    Example:
        >>> import asyncpg
        >>> pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(dsn="postgresql://...")
        >>> handler = HandlerPostgresCleanupTopics(pool)
        >>> result = await handler.handle(payload, correlation_id)
