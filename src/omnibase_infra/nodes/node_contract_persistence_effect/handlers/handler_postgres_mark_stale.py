"""Handler for batch marking stale contracts as inactive.

This handler encapsulates PostgreSQL-specific staleness marking logic for the
NodeContractPersistenceEffect node, following the declarative node pattern where
handlers are extracted for testability and separation of concerns.

Architecture:
    HandlerPostgresMarkStale is responsible for:
    - Executing batch update operations against PostgreSQL
    - Returning structured ModelBackendResult with affected row count

    Timing, error classification, and sanitization are delegated to
    MixinPostgresOpExecutor to eliminate boilerplate drift across handlers.

Operation:
    Marks all active contracts with last_seen_at before the stale_cutoff
    timestamp as inactive. This is a batch operation that may affect
    multiple rows in a single execution.

SQL:
    UPDATE contracts
    SET is_active = FALSE, deregistered_at = $1
    WHERE is_active = TRUE AND last_seen_at < $2

Coroutine Safety:
    This handler is stateless and coroutine-safe for concurrent calls
    with different payload instances. Thread-safety depends on the
    underlying asyncpg.Pool implementation.

class HandlerPostgresMarkStale(MixinPostgresOpExecutor):
    """Handler for batch marking stale contracts as inactive.

    Encapsulates PostgreSQL-specific batch staleness marking logic extracted
    from NodeContractPersistenceEffect for declarative node compliance.

    Timing, error classification, and sanitization are handled by the
    MixinPostgresOpExecutor base class, reducing boilerplate and ensuring
    consistent error handling across all PostgreSQL handlers.

    The staleness operation marks contracts as inactive if their last_seen_at
    timestamp is older than the specified stale_cutoff, supporting contract
    lifecycle management through automatic deregistration of stale nodes.

    Attributes:
        _pool: asyncpg connection pool for database operations.

    Example:
        >>> from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock
        >>> conn = MagicMock()
        >>> conn.execute = AsyncMock(return_value="UPDATE 5")
        >>> pool = MagicMock()
        >>> pool.acquire = MagicMock(return_value=AsyncContextManager(conn))
        >>> handler = HandlerPostgresMarkStale(pool)
        >>> payload = MagicMock(stale_cutoff=datetime.now(), checked_at=datetime.now())
        >>> result = await handler.handle(payload, uuid4())
        >>> result.success
        True
