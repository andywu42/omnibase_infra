"""Session Lifecycle State Model for Pure Reducer Pattern.

Immutable state model for the session lifecycle FSM. Follows the
pure reducer pattern where state is passed in and returned from
reduce(), with no internal mutation.

FSM States:
    - idle: No active run — waiting for pipeline start
    - run_created: Run document created, not yet active
    - run_active: Run is actively executing
    - run_ended: Run has completed or been terminated

Concurrency Model:
    - Each pipeline creates its own runs/{run_id}.json
    - session.json updates are append-only for recent_run_ids
    - active_run_id is advisory (for interactive sessions)
    - Multiple active runs allowed; destructive ops denied
      until /onex:set-active-run {run_id} disambiguates

Defensive Copy (Immutability) Pattern:
    All ``with_*`` transition methods return **new** frozen instances rather
    than mutating the current object.  This is a defensive-copy approach:
    callers always receive an independent snapshot, so no reference held
    elsewhere can observe a state change.  Because every field is either a
    primitive or ``None``, a shallow copy (via Pydantic model construction)
    is sufficient — there are no mutable containers to worry about.
