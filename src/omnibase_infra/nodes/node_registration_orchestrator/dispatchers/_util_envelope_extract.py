"""Shared utility for extracting correlation_id and raw_payload from dispatcher envelopes.

The dispatch engine materializes envelopes to dicts before calling dispatchers
(serialization boundary). All dispatchers need to handle both ModelEventEnvelope
objects and materialized dicts — this helper centralizes that logic.
