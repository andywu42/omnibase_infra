"""Minimal projection record wrapper model.

This model wraps projection record data into a Pydantic BaseModel for use
with ModelPayloadPostgresUpsertRegistration. Critical columns are declared
as explicit fields for validation. Dynamic projection columns (which vary
by projector schema) are stored in the ``data`` dict field.
