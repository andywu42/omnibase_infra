"""In-memory store for node event bus publish topics accumulated from introspection events.

This service accumulates the ``event_bus.publish_topics`` from every
``ModelNodeIntrospectionEvent`` processed by the registration orchestrator.
It is shared between:

    1. ``HandlerNodeIntrospected`` — updates the store on each introspection event.
    2. ``HandlerCatalogRequest`` — reads the store to build a catalog response.

Thread Safety:
    Uses ``asyncio.Lock`` for coroutine-safe reads and writes. All public methods
    are ``async`` to enforce consistent lock acquisition patterns.

Design:
    - Key: ``node_id`` (UUID as string) — one entry per registered node.
    - Value: ``frozenset[str]`` of environment-qualified topic strings.
    - Topics are stored as received from ``event_bus.publish_topics`` entries.
    - Filtering to ``onex.evt.*`` is performed at read time, not write time,
      to preserve the full set for future use cases.
