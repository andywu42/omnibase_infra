"""Contract registration event router.

Routes Kafka messages to ContractRegistryReducer and executes resulting intents.

An extracted event router for routing contract lifecycle
events (registration, deregistration, heartbeat) to the ContractRegistryReducer.
The router also runs an internal tick timer for periodic staleness computation.

Design:
    This class encapsulates the message routing logic for contract registry
    projection. By extracting it, we enable:
    - Unit testing without full kernel bootstrap
    - Mocking of dependencies for isolation
    - Clearer separation between bootstrap and event routing

    The router uses ProtocolEventBusLike for event publishing, enabling
    duck typing with any event bus implementation (Kafka, InMemory, etc.).

Message Flow:
    1. Parse message as ModelEventEnvelope[dict]
    2. Validate payload as event type (ModelContractRegisteredEvent,
       ModelContractDeregisteredEvent, ModelNodeHeartbeatEvent)
    3. Call reducer.reduce(state, event, metadata)
    4. Execute returned intents via _execute_intents()
    5. Log errors (no exceptions raised to consumer)

class ContractRegistrationEventRouter:
    """Routes contract lifecycle events to reducer and executes intents.

    This router handles incoming event messages from Kafka, parses them as
    contract lifecycle events, and routes them to the ContractRegistryReducer.
    It also maintains an internal tick timer for periodic staleness computation.

    The router propagates correlation IDs from incoming messages for
    distributed tracing. If no correlation ID is present, it generates
    a new one to ensure all operations can be traced.

    This class follows the container-based dependency injection pattern,
    receiving a ModelONEXContainer for service resolution while also
    accepting explicit dependencies for router-specific configuration.

    Message Flow:
        1. Parse message as ModelEventEnvelope[dict]
        2. Validate payload as event type (ModelContractRegisteredEvent, etc.)
        3. Call reducer.reduce(state, event, metadata)
        4. Execute returned intents via _execute_intents()
        5. Log errors (no exceptions raised to consumer)

    Tick Timer:
        The router runs an internal tick timer at configurable intervals
        (default 60s, minimum 5s). Each tick emits a ModelRuntimeTick event
        to the reducer for staleness computation.

    Attributes:
        _container: ONEX service container for dependency resolution.
        _reducer: The ContractRegistryReducer to route events to.
        _effect_handlers: Dict mapping intent_type to handler instances.
        _event_bus: Event bus implementing ProtocolEventBusLike (optional).
        _tick_interval_seconds: Interval between staleness ticks.
        _state: Current reducer state (mutable, updated after each reduction).
        _shutdown_event: Event for graceful shutdown of tick loop.
        _tick_task: Background task for tick loop.
        _tick_sequence: Monotonically increasing counter for tick events.

    Example:
        >>> from omnibase_core.container import ModelONEXContainer
        >>> container = ModelONEXContainer()
        >>> router = ContractRegistrationEventRouter(
        ...     container=container,
