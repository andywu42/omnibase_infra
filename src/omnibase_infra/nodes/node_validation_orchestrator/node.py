"""NodeValidationOrchestrator - Declarative ORCHESTRATOR for validation pipeline.

Coordinates the validation pipeline: receives pattern candidates, builds
validation plans, dispatches to executor and adjudicator, publishes results.

All behavior is defined in contract.yaml -- no custom logic here.

This orchestrator follows the ONEX declarative pattern:
    - DECLARATIVE orchestrator driven by contract.yaml
    - Zero custom routing logic - all behavior from workflow_definition
    - Used for ONEX-compliant runtime execution via RuntimeHostProcess
    - Pattern: "Contract-driven, handlers wired by registry"

Workflow Pattern:
    1. Receive pattern candidate (consumed_events in contract)
    2. Build validation plan via HandlerBuildPlan (handler_routing)
    3. Execute checks via executor (workflow_definition.execution_graph)
    4. Adjudicate results (workflow_definition.execution_graph)
    5. Update lifecycle and publish results (published_events in contract)

Workflow: build_plan -> execute_checks -> adjudicate -> update_lifecycle

Handler Routing:
    Handler routing is defined declaratively in contract.yaml under
    handler_routing section. The orchestrator does NOT contain custom
    dispatch logic - the base class routes events based on:
    - routing_strategy: "payload_type_match"
    - handlers: mapping of event_model to handler_class

Design Decisions:
    - 100% Contract-Driven: All workflow logic in YAML, not Python
    - Zero Custom Methods: Base class handles everything
    - Declarative Execution: Workflow steps defined in execution_graph
    - Retry at Base Class: NodeOrchestrator owns retry policy
    - Contract-Driven Wiring: Handlers wired via handler_routing in contract.yaml

Coroutine Safety:
    This orchestrator is NOT coroutine-safe. Each instance should handle one
    workflow at a time. For concurrent workflows, create multiple instances.

Related Modules:
    - contract.yaml: Workflow definition, execution graph, and handler routing
    - handlers/: Handler implementations (HandlerBuildPlan)
    - registry/: RegistryInfraValidationOrchestrator for handler wiring

    Handler Routing:
