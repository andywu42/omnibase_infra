"""Validation verdict model emitted by the adjudicator reducer.

The verdict is the final output of the validation pipeline for a given
candidate.  It summarises all check results into a single
PASS / FAIL / QUARANTINE decision together with scoring metadata.

Scoring Policy:
    1. Any REQUIRED check failure -> FAIL (hard block).
    2. Score < threshold but no hard blocks -> QUARANTINE (soft block).
    3. All REQUIRED pass and score >= threshold -> PASS.

The ``from_state`` classmethod encapsulates this scoring logic so that
callers only need to supply the adjudicator state and a threshold.
