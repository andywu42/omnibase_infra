    Attributes:
        purged_count: Total number of messages permanently deleted across
            all archive labels.
        label_counts: Per-label count of messages deleted. Keys are label
            names (not IDs); values are delete counts.
        hard_failed: True if any label's search_messages call raised an
            exception (the label was skipped entirely). Individual message
            delete failures do not set this flag.
        errors: Non-fatal error messages for individual delete failures.
            Also includes hard-failure messages for skipped labels.
        events_published: Number of summary events published by the
            node shell / runtime. Set by the runtime after publishing
            pending_events.
        pending_events: List of event payloads for the runtime to publish.
            The handler always returns at most one payload (the summary
            event) when purged_count > 0 or any errors exist.
