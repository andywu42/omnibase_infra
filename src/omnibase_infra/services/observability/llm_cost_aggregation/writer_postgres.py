"""PostgreSQL Writer for LLM cost aggregation.

A PostgreSQL writer for persisting LLM cost aggregation
data consumed from Kafka. It handles upsert semantics for the
``llm_cost_aggregates`` table and insert-only semantics for ``llm_call_metrics``.

Design Decisions:
    - Pool injection: asyncpg.Pool is injected, not created/managed
    - Batch inserts for llm_call_metrics (append-only)
    - Upsert for llm_cost_aggregates (UNIQUE on aggregation_key + window)
    - Event deduplication via event_id tracking (in-memory set, bounded)
    - Circuit breaker: MixinAsyncCircuitBreaker for resilience

Idempotency Contract:
    | Table               | Unique Key                       | Conflict Action     |
    |---------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
    | llm_call_metrics    | id (UUID PK)                     | DO NOTHING          |
    | llm_cost_aggregates | (aggregation_key, window)        | DO UPDATE (additive)|
