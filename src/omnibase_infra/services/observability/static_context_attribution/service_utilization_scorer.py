"""Edit-distance utilization scorer for static context attribution.

Measures how much of each static context section was actually used in a
model response. Uses edit-distance anchoring between section content
fragments and response content for evidence-based attribution.

The approach:
1. Split each section into fragments (sentences / significant lines)
2. For each fragment, search for approximate matches in the response
   using normalized edit distance
3. Score = matched_fragments / total_fragments

This is evidence-based, not heuristic. A fragment is "matched" only
when its normalized edit distance to some substring of the response
falls below a configurable threshold.
