"""Row model for the baselines_breakdown table.

Represents per-pattern performance breakdown for the /api/baselines/breakdown
endpoint. One row per selected_agent (treated as a pattern proxy).

Confidence Field Semantics:
    The ``confidence`` field is a **proxy** for sample sufficiency, not a
    statistical confidence interval. It is set to ``treatment_success_rate``
    when ``sample_count >= 20``, and ``NULL`` below that threshold. A non-NULL
    value signals that the sample size is large enough to treat the success
    rate as meaningful; it does not represent a probability or significance level.

Construction from asyncpg Records:
    ``from_attributes=True`` in the model config enables constructing
    instances directly from asyncpg ``Record`` objects (which expose column
    values as attributes), without an intermediate ``dict(**row)`` conversion.

    Represents a single pattern's treatment vs control performance.

    Attributes:
        id: Primary key UUID.

        control_success_rate: Success rate in control cohort.
        roi_pct: Pattern-specific ROI percentage.
        sample_count: Total sessions for this pattern.
