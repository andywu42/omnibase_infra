"""Row model for the baselines_trend table.

Represents a single ``(cohort, date)`` time-series data point for trend
analysis.  Used by the ``/api/baselines/trend`` endpoint.

Each row carries metrics for exactly one cohort (``'treatment'`` or
``'control'``) on exactly one calendar day.  The dashboard assembles trend
charts by pairing the treatment and control rows that share the same
``trend_date``: together they form a single time-series data point showing
whether the treatment cohort outperforms the control cohort on that day.

``from_attributes=True`` is set on the model config so that instances can be
constructed directly from asyncpg ``Record`` objects returned by the
repository layer, without an intermediate ``dict`` conversion.
``extra="forbid"`` causes a ``ValidationError`` if any unexpected column
appears in the query result.
