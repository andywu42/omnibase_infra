"""Row model for the baselines_comparisons table.

Represents a single daily A/B comparison between treatment and control groups.
Used as both the DB row representation and the API response model for
``/api/baselines/comparisons`` and ``/api/baselines/summary``.

``from_attributes=True`` is set on the model config so that instances can be
constructed directly from asyncpg ``Record`` objects (or any ORM row) returned
by the repository layer — no intermediate ``dict`` conversion is required.
``extra="forbid"`` ensures that any unexpected column returned by a query
raises a ``ValidationError`` immediately rather than silently being dropped.

    Represents a daily A/B comparison between treatment (sessions with
    high-confidence pattern injection) and control (sessions without or
    with low-confidence injection) groups.

    Attributes:
        id: Primary key UUID.
        comparison_date: The date this comparison covers.
        period_label: Human-readable period label (e.g. "2026-02-18").
        treatment_sessions: Count of treatment group sessions.
        treatment_success_rate: Success rate in treatment group (0.0-1.0).
        treatment_avg_latency_ms: Average latency for treatment sessions.
        treatment_avg_cost_tokens: Average token usage in treatment group.
        treatment_total_tokens: Total tokens consumed by treatment sessions.
        control_sessions: Count of control group sessions.
        control_success_rate: Success rate in control group (0.0-1.0).
        control_avg_latency_ms: Average latency for control sessions.
        control_avg_cost_tokens: Average token usage in control group.
        control_total_tokens: Total tokens consumed by control sessions.
        roi_pct: ROI percentage. Positive = treatment outperforms control.
        latency_improvement_pct: Latency improvement %. Positive = treatment faster.
        cost_improvement_pct: Cost improvement %. Positive = treatment cheaper.
        sample_size: Total sessions (treatment + control).
        computed_at: When this row was last computed.
        created_at: When this row was first created.
        updated_at: When this row was last updated.
