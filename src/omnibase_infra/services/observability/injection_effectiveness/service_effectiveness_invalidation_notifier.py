"""Invalidation notifier for effectiveness measurement updates.

Publishes Kafka events when new measurement data is written to effectiveness
tables, enabling downstream consumers (dashboards, WebSocket servers) to
refresh their cached data.

Design Decisions:
    - Fire-and-forget: Notification failures are logged but never raise.
      Measurement persistence is the primary concern; notifications are
      best-effort.
    - Single topic: All invalidation events go to one topic. Consumers
      filter by tables_affected if they only care about specific tables.
    - JSON serialization: Events are serialized as JSON for broad
      consumer compatibility.

Example:
    >>> from aiokafka import AIOKafkaProducer
    >>> from omnibase_infra.services.observability.injection_effectiveness.service_effectiveness_invalidation_notifier import (
    ...     ServiceEffectivenessInvalidationNotifier,
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> producer = AIOKafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers="localhost:9092")
    >>> await producer.start()
    >>> notifier = ServiceEffectivenessInvalidationNotifier(producer)
    >>>
    >>> await notifier.notify(
    ...     tables_affected=("injection_effectiveness", "pattern_hit_rates"),
    ...     rows_written=42,
    ...     source="kafka_consumer",
    ...     correlation_id=some_uuid,
