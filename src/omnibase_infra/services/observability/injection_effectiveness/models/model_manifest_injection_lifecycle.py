"""Manifest injection lifecycle event models.

Represents payloads from the three manifest injection lifecycle topics
emitted by omniclaude hooks (OMN-1888 audit trail).

Topics consumed:
    - onex.evt.omniclaude.manifest-injection-started.v1
    - onex.evt.omniclaude.manifest-injected.v1
    - onex.evt.omniclaude.manifest-injection-failed.v1

The same Pydantic model handles all three topics. The ``event_type``
discriminator field identifies which lifecycle stage was recorded.

class ModelManifestInjectionLifecycleEvent(BaseModel):
    """Manifest injection lifecycle event from omniclaude hooks.

    Emitted at each stage of agent manifest loading:
        - ``manifest_injection_started``: Injection attempt begins.
        - ``manifest_injected``: Injection completed successfully.
        - ``manifest_injection_failed``: Injection failed with error.

    This event populates the ``manifest_injection_lifecycle`` table,
    providing the end-to-end audit trail required by OMN-1888.

    Attributes:
        event_type: Lifecycle stage discriminator.
        entity_id: Session identifier as UUID (partition key).
        session_id: Session identifier as UUID.
        correlation_id: Correlation ID for distributed tracing.
        causation_id: ID of the prompt event that triggered injection.
        emitted_at: Timestamp when the hook emitted this event (UTC).
        agent_label: Label/display name of the agent being loaded.
        agent_domain: Domain of the agent.
        injection_success: Whether the manifest injection succeeded.
            None for ``manifest_injection_started`` events (outcome unknown).
        injection_duration_ms: Time to load and inject manifest (ms).
            None for ``manifest_injection_started`` events (not yet complete).
        routing_source: How the agent was selected.
        agent_version: Version of the agent definition if specified.
        yaml_path: Path to the agent YAML file (optional, for debugging).
        error_message: Error details if injection failed.
        error_type: Error classification if injection failed.

    Example:
        >>> from datetime import UTC, datetime
        >>> from uuid import uuid4
