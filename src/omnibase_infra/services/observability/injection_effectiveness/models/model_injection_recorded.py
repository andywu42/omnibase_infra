    Emitted when a context injection is recorded during a session.

    Attributes:
        session_id: Session identifier for correlation.

        emitted_at: Timestamp when the hook emitted this event (UTC).

        injection_latency_ms: Time to perform the injection in milliseconds.
        agent_name: Agent that triggered the injection.
        repo: Repository name derived from project_path.
