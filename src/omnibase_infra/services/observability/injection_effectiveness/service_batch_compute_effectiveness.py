"""Batch computation for effectiveness metrics from existing observability data.

Derives injection effectiveness metrics from the existing ``agent_actions``
and ``agent_routing_decisions`` tables, populating the three effectiveness
measurement tables (``injection_effectiveness``, ``latency_breakdowns``,
``pattern_hit_rates``).

This module bridges the gap when the Kafka pipeline is not yet producing
events: it computes effectiveness metrics from data that already exists
in the database, seeding the effectiveness tables with real measurements.

Design Decisions:
    - Read from agent_actions + agent_routing_decisions (already populated)
    - Write to injection_effectiveness, latency_breakdowns, pattern_hit_rates
    - Idempotent: Uses ON CONFLICT to avoid duplicates on re-runs
    - Batched: Processes in configurable batch sizes for memory efficiency
    - Pool injection: asyncpg.Pool injected, lifecycle managed externally
    - Correlation-aware: Joins on correlation_id to link actions to routing

Metrics Derivation Logic:
    - **injection_effectiveness**: One row per unique correlation_id from
      agent_routing_decisions. Utilization derived from action success rates.
      Agent match fields are NULL until expected-agent tracking is available.
    - **latency_breakdowns**: One row per agent_action with total duration_ms.
      Sub-component latencies (routing, retrieval, injection) are NULL
      because individual timing is not yet instrumented.
    - **pattern_hit_rates**: Aggregated from routing decisions grouped by
      selected_agent, treating agent selection as the "pattern".

        All writes are idempotent (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING / DO UPDATE).
        Individual phase failures are caught and recorded in the result's

            asyncio.CancelledError: If the coroutine is cancelled during

                (not ``Exception``) and is not caught by any of the
                per-phase ``except Exception`` blocks, nor by the notifier's
                internal ``except Exception`` handler, so it propagates
                unconditionally.

                Note:
                    Pool acquisition errors (``asyncpg.PostgresError``,
                    ``OSError``) occur inside each phase's

                    **inside** the per-phase try/except, so these are
                    captured as phase errors rather than raised.

                    The notifier unconditionally suppresses all
                    ``Exception`` subclasses internally, so notifier
                    failures never propagate to the caller.

                Phase-level errors (per-phase SQL failures) are captured
                in ``result.errors`` and do not raise.

            cursor or offset mechanism. If the number of distinct agents in
            ``agent_routing_decisions`` exceeds ``batch_size``, only the
            first ``batch_size`` agents (ordered alphabetically by name) are
            processed. Agents beyond the cap are silently skipped until the
            next run -- but since the ordering and cap are deterministic, the
            same agents are skipped every run. A warning is logged when the
            result count equals ``batch_size`` to surface this condition.

        Args:
            correlation_id: Correlation ID for tracing.

        Returns:
            Number of rows written. If this equals ``batch_size``, some
            agents may have been truncated (see Note above).
