"""Local resolution event model for the event ledger publisher.

This model mirrors the essential fields of ``ModelResolutionEvent`` from
omnibase_core (created in PR #575). It exists here as a local schema so
the infra publisher can operate independently of the core package release
cycle.

TODO(OMN-2895): Replace this local model with the canonical import once
    omnibase_core PR #575 merges and a release containing
    ``omnibase_core.models.routing.model_resolution_event.ModelResolutionEvent``
    is available as a dependency.

Fields mirror the plan specification from Phase 6:
    - event_id: Unique identifier for this resolution event
    - timestamp: When the resolution was performed
    - registry_snapshot_hash: BLAKE3 hash of the provider registry at resolution time
    - policy_bundle_hash: SHA-256 of the policy bundle used
    - trust_graph_hash: SHA-256 of the trust graph used
    - tier_progression: Ordered list of tier attempts with timing
    - proofs_attempted: List of resolution proofs attempted
    - success: Whether resolution succeeded
    - failure_code: Structured failure code (if failed)
    - failure_reason: Human-readable failure description (if failed)
    - route_plan_id: UUID of the resulting route plan (if succeeded)
    - dependency_capability: The capability that was resolved
