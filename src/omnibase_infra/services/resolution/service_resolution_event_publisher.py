"""Publisher service for resolution decision audit events.

Publishes ``ModelResolutionEventLocal`` instances to the
``onex.evt.platform.resolution-decided.v1`` topic via the event bus,
recording every tiered dependency resolution decision for audit, replay,
and intelligence.

Design Decisions:
    - **Bus-agnostic**: Accepts any object satisfying ``ProtocolEventBusLike``
      (both ``EventBusKafka`` and ``EventBusInmemory`` work).
    - **Fire-and-forget**: Publish failures are logged at WARNING level and
      never raised. The resolution decision has already been made; audit
      publishing must not block or fail the resolution path.
    - **JSON serialization**: Events are serialized via Pydantic
      ``model_dump(mode="json")`` for broad consumer compatibility.
    - **Service layer**: Named ``Service*`` (not ``Handler*``) to comply
      with ARCH-002 (handlers must not publish to the event bus).

Architecture:
    This service sits at the service layer, called by orchestrators or
    the tiered resolution service after a resolution decision is made.
    It wraps the event bus publish call with:
    - Structured logging with correlation tracking
    - JSON serialization of the resolution event model
    - Error isolation (publish failures never propagate)
