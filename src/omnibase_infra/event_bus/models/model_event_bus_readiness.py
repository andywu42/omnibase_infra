"""Event bus readiness status model.

Provides structured readiness information for Kafka event bus consumers,
separating readiness (can process events) from liveness (process alive).

This model is used by:
    - ``EventBusKafka.get_readiness_status()`` to report consumer readiness
    - ``RuntimeHostProcess.readiness_check()`` to aggregate readiness
    - ``ServiceHealth._handle_readiness()`` to serve ``/ready`` endpoint

    consumers with partition assignments.

    Readiness is continuously evaluated, not a one-time gate. Loss of
    required consumer assignments flips readiness to False.
