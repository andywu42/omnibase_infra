"""LLM Finish Reason Enumeration.

Defines canonical finish reasons for LLM API responses. Used to normalize
provider-specific finish reason strings into a consistent enum across
all LLM integrations (OpenAI, vLLM, Ollama, etc.).

Finish reasons:
    - STOP: Model completed generation naturally
    - LENGTH: Output was truncated due to max_tokens limit
    - ERROR: Model or provider error during generation
    - CONTENT_FILTER: Content was filtered by safety systems
    - TOOL_CALLS: Model requested tool/function calls
    - UNKNOWN: Unrecognized provider-specific reason (fallback)
