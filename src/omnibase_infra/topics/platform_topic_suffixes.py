"""Platform and domain topic suffixes for ONEX infrastructure.

This module defines topic suffixes for:
  1. Platform-reserved topics (producer: ``platform``) -- infrastructure internals
  2. Domain plugin topics (producer: ``omniintelligence``, ``pattern``, etc.) --
     provisioned by the runtime so domain plugins find their topics ready.

Domain services should NOT import individual suffix constants from this module.
They should subscribe to topics by name from their own contracts. The combined
``ALL_PROVISIONED_TOPIC_SPECS`` registry is consumed by ``TopicProvisioner`` at
startup to create all required topics.

Topic Suffix Format:
    onex.<kind>.<producer>.<event-name>.v<version>

    Structure:
        - onex: Required prefix for all ONEX topics
        - kind: Message category (evt, cmd, intent, snapshot, dlq)
        - producer: Routing domain -- ``platform`` for infrastructure,
          domain name for plugins (e.g., ``omniintelligence``)
        - event-name: Descriptive name using kebab-case
        - version: Semantic version (v1, v2, etc.)

    Kinds:
        evt - Event topics (state changes, notifications)
        cmd - Command topics (requests for action)
        intent - Intent topics (internal workflow coordination)
        snapshot - Snapshot topics (periodic state snapshots)
        dlq - Dead letter queue topics

    Examples:
        onex.evt.platform.node-registration.v1
        onex.cmd.platform.request-introspection.v1
        onex.intent.platform.runtime-tick.v1
        onex.cmd.omniintelligence.claude-hook-event.v1

Usage:
    from omnibase_infra.topics import SUFFIX_NODE_REGISTRATION

    # Compose full topic with tenant/namespace prefix
    full_topic = f"{tenant}.{namespace}.{SUFFIX_NODE_REGISTRATION}"

See Also:
