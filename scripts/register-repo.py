"""Register repos and seed shared platform secrets into Infisical.

This script is the central onboarding tool for the OmniNode platform's
Infisical-based secret management system. It has two subcommands:

    seed-shared
        Populate /shared/<transport>/ paths in Infisical with all
        platform-wide credentials (postgres host/user, kafka, consul,
        LLM endpoints, API keys, etc.). Run once after provisioning.

    onboard-repo
        Create /services/<repo>/ folder structure and seed repo-specific
        secrets (e.g. POSTGRES_DATABASE). Run once per new downstream repo.

Both subcommands are dry-run by default. Pass --execute to write.

~/.omnibase/.env contains bootstrap credentials plus shared platform keys.
Bootstrap-only lines (circular Infisical dependency — must stay in .env):
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=...
    INFISICAL_ADDR=http://localhost:8880
    INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID=...
    INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET=...
    INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID=...

All other platform-wide configuration lives in Infisical under /shared/*.

Usage:
    # Populate /shared/ paths from the platform env file (dry-run)
    uv run python scripts/register-repo.py seed-shared \\
        --env-file ~/.omnibase/.env

    # Apply the shared seed
    uv run python scripts/register-repo.py seed-shared \\
        --env-file ~/.omnibase/.env --execute

    # Onboard a downstream repo (dry-run)
    uv run python scripts/register-repo.py onboard-repo \\
        --repo omniclaude \\
        --env-file /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omniclaude/.env

    # Apply the onboarding
    uv run python scripts/register-repo.py onboard-repo \\
        --repo omniclaude \\
        --env-file /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omniclaude/.env --execute

        # codes (e.g. an HTTP status attribute or a structured exception
        # subclass) that would let us cleanly identify a 404 "secret not
        # found" response without parsing message strings.  The string

        # therefore a best-effort heuristic that may break if the SDK
        # changes its error message wording in a future release.
        #

        # once the Infisical SDK exposes typed status codes or a dedicated
        # SecretNotFoundError subclass.  Track against the SDK changelog
