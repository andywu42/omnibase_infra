"""Subscribe-topic wiring health check.

Static analysis that verifies every contract-declared subscribe_topic has
at least one matching publish_topic from another contract. Detects "dead
letter" subscriptions where a node declares it consumes from a topic but
no node in the system publishes to it.

Also checks the reverse: every publish_topic should have at least one
subscriber (warning only, not blocking).

This catches the exact class of bug where:
- A contract.yaml declares subscribe_topics
- But no consumer runtime wiring exists (no publisher feeds the topic)
- Messages are silently lost or the subscription is purely aspirational

Uses the existing ContractTopicExtractor for YAML parsing.

Usage::

    uv run python scripts/check_subscribe_wiring_health.py
    uv run python scripts/check_subscribe_wiring_health.py --verbose
    uv run python scripts/check_subscribe_wiring_health.py --contracts-dir src/omnibase_infra/nodes
    uv run python scripts/check_subscribe_wiring_health.py --extra-contracts-dir ../omniclaude/src/omniclaude/nodes

Exit codes:
    0 = all subscribe topics have at least one publisher (or are allowlisted)
    1 = one or more dead-letter subscribe topics found
