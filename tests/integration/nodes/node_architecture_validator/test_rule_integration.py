"""Integration tests for Rule classes with NodeArchitectureValidator.

introduced in PR #124:
    - RuleNoDirectDispatch (ARCH-001)
    - RuleNoHandlerPublishing (ARCH-002)
    - RuleNoOrchestratorFSM (ARCH-003)

Test Categories:
    1. Multi-Rule Validation: Testing all rules together on mixed files
    2. Result Aggregation: Verifying violations are properly collected
    3. Statelessness: Confirming rules produce consistent results across calls
    4. Thread Safety: Verifying concurrent execution produces correct results
    5. Pipeline Integration: Testing full validation from rules through results

        This is a GAP DOCUMENTATION test, NOT a correlation_id propagation test.

        Purpose:
            Verify that ModelArchitectureValidationRequest (file-based) and
            ModelFileValidationResult do NOT have correlation_id fields.
            This documents a feature gap compared to the node/handler-based
            validation models (OMN-1138) which DO support correlation_id.

        Context:
            - ModelArchitectureValidationRequest (model_validation_request.py):
              File-based validation - NO correlation_id field
            - ModelArchitectureValidationRequest (model_architecture_validation_request.py):
              Node/handler-based validation - HAS correlation_id field
            - ModelFileValidationResult: NO correlation_id field
            - ModelArchitectureValidationResult (OMN-1138): HAS correlation_id field

        Future Enhancement:
            When correlation_id support is added to file-based validation:
            1. Add correlation_id field to ModelArchitectureValidationRequest
               (in model_validation_request.py)
            2. Add correlation_id field to ModelFileValidationResult
            3. Update this test to verify correlation_id propagation from
               request through to result
