"""Pytest fixtures for correlation ID propagation integration tests.  # ai-slop-ok: pre-existing

This module provides fixtures and helper classes for testing correlation ID
propagation across service boundaries. The fixtures capture structured log
records and generate test correlation IDs, while mock handlers simulate
publisher/subscriber patterns with correlation tracking.

Fixtures:
    log_capture: Captures structured log records for correlation ID assertion
    correlation_id: Generates a unique correlation ID for testing
    event_bus: Creates a SimpleAsyncEventBus instance for testing

Helper Functions:
    assert_correlation_in_logs: Assert correlation ID appears in logs for given boundary

Test Infrastructure:
    SimpleAsyncEventBus: Minimal event bus for correlation propagation testing
    AsyncMessageHandler: Type alias for async message handlers

Mock Handlers:
    MockHandlerA: Publisher handler that emits events with correlation tracking
    MockHandlerB: Subscriber handler that can optionally fail for testing error paths
    MockHandlerBForwarding: Handler variant that forwards messages to another topic
    MockHandlerC: Handler for third-leg chain testing

        """Test-specific protocol for SimpleAsyncEventBus - NOT interchangeable with production.

        WHY THIS CANNOT USE PRODUCTION PROTOCOL:
        -----------------------------------------
        The production ProtocolEventBusLike (omnibase_infra.protocols) has a different
        signature optimized for Kafka/binary message passing:

            Production: async def publish(topic: str, key: bytes | None, value: bytes) -> None
            Test:       async def publish(topic: str, message: dict[str, object]) -> None

        Key differences:
        1. Production uses bytes (key/value) for Kafka wire format compatibility
        2. Production requires a 'key' parameter for partitioning (even if None)
        3. Test uses dict[str, object] for simpler correlation ID verification
        4. Test omits 'key' as partitioning is irrelevant to correlation testing

        ADAPTER PATTERN CONSIDERATION:
        ------------------------------
        An adapter wrapping SimpleAsyncEventBus to implement ProtocolEventBusLike was
        considered but rejected because:
        1. It would require JSON serialization/deserialization overhead for no benefit
        2. The tests specifically verify dict-based message passing (correlation_id as key)
        3. Production code already has InMemoryEventBus that implements the full protocol
        4. These tests focus on correlation propagation logic, not message serialization

        RELATION TO PRODUCTION BEHAVIOR:
        --------------------------------
        While the interface differs, the semantics tested are identical to production:
        - Messages published to a topic reach all subscribers (same as Kafka consumer groups)
        - Messages contain correlation_id that must propagate unchanged
        - Handler chains (A -> B -> C) preserve correlation context

        The SimpleAsyncEventBus used in tests provides the minimal pub/sub needed to
        verify correlation propagation without external dependencies (Kafka, InMemoryEventBus
        lifecycle management).
