"""CI-friendly integration tests for correlation ID propagation.  # ai-slop-ok: pre-existing

This module provides integration tests that verify correlation IDs are properly
propagated across handler boundaries. The tests use mock handlers and a simple
async event bus to simulate real-world message passing scenarios.

Test Coverage:
    - Handler-to-handler correlation preservation
    - Correlation ID in error context
    - Correlation ID at log boundaries
    - Multi-handler chain propagation

These tests are designed to run in CI environments without external dependencies.
