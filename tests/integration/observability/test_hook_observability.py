"""Integration tests for HookObservability.

This module tests the observability hook implementation with critical focus on:
- Contextvars isolation (no shared state between async operations)
- before_operation/after_operation timing accuracy
- Metrics integration with ProtocolHotPathMetricsSink
- Context manager support for scoped timing
- Concurrent operations don't interfere with each other

CRITICAL: Contextvars Isolation
-------------------------------
The HookObservability class uses contextvars instead of instance variables for
all timing and operation state. This is a CRITICAL design decision for async
safety. These tests verify this behavior extensively.

Why NOT instance variables:
    # WRONG - Race condition in async code!
    class BadHook:
        def __init__(self):
            self._start_time = 0.0  # Shared across all concurrent operations!

    # In async code, multiple tasks share the same instance:
    hook.before_operation("op_a")  # Sets _start_time = 100
    # Task switches to another operation
    hook.before_operation("op_b")  # OVERWRITES _start_time = 200
    # Back to op_a, but _start_time is wrong!
    hook.after_operation()  # Returns wrong duration!

Why contextvars ARE correct:
    Each async task gets its own isolated context. Even with the same hook
    instance, concurrent operations don't interfere because contextvars
    provide per-task storage.
