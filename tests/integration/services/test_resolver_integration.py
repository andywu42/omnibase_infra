"""Integration tests for `resolve_project_tracker()`.

Unlike the unit tests in `tests/services/test_resolver.py`, these exercise
the resolver against a real `LocalStubProjectTracker` backing file on disk
and assert the returned instance satisfies the `ProtocolProjectTracker`
behavioral contract end-to-end (connect → create_issue → get_issue → close).
