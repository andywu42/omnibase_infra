"""Pytest fixtures for registration handler integration tests.  # ai-slop-ok: pre-existing

This module provides fixtures for testing registration handlers against real
PostgreSQL using testcontainers. Reuses projector fixtures and adds handler-
specific fixtures for heartbeat processing tests.

IMPORTANT: Event Loop Scope Configuration (pytest-asyncio 0.25+)
================================================================  # ai-slop-ok: pre-existing

This module imports session-scoped async fixtures from ``tests/integration/projectors/conftest.py``.
When using these fixtures, ensure your test module has proper loop scope configuration:

.. code-block:: python

    pytestmark = [pytest.mark.asyncio(loop_scope="session")]

Without this, you may encounter RuntimeError: "Task got Future attached to a different loop"
due to pytest-asyncio 0.25+ defaulting to function-scoped event loops.

See ``tests/integration/projectors/conftest.py`` for detailed documentation.

Fixture Hierarchy:
    Session-scoped:
        - docker_available (from projectors)
        - postgres_container (from projectors)
        - event_loop_policy (from projectors)

    Function-scoped:
        - pg_pool (from projectors)
        - projector (from projectors) - ProjectorShell instance
        - reader (from projectors)
        - heartbeat_handler: HandlerNodeHeartbeat instance

Usage:
    The fixtures handle:
    1. Container lifecycle management (via projector fixtures)
    2. Handler initialization with projector and reader
    3. Test isolation through schema reset

# =============================================================================
# Cross-Module Fixture Imports
# =============================================================================
# These fixtures are imported from tests/integration/projectors/conftest.py
# to provide shared PostgreSQL testcontainer infrastructure for handler tests.
#
# Why imported:
#   - Reuses expensive PostgreSQL container setup (session-scoped)
#   - Ensures consistent schema initialization across projector and handler tests
#   - Provides test isolation via TRUNCATE in pg_pool fixture teardown
#
# Imported constants:
#   - DOCKER_AVAILABLE: Module constant - True if Docker is running
#   - SCHEMA_FILE: Path to registration_projections schema SQL
#
# Imported fixtures:
#   - docker_available: Session fixture - Docker availability check
#   - event_loop_policy: Session fixture - asyncio event loop policy
#   - postgres_container: Session fixture - PostgreSQL testcontainer (expensive)
#   - pg_pool: Function fixture - Fresh asyncpg pool per test (isolated)
#   - projector: Function fixture - ProjectorShell instance (contract-driven)
#   - reader: Function fixture - ProjectionReaderRegistration instance
#
# These are re-exported in __all__ for pytest discovery.
