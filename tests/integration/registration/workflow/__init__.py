"""Workflow integration tests for node registration E2E scenarios.

This package provides mocked E2E tests for the registration workflow,
proving the architecture with ZERO real infrastructure dependencies.

Test Files:
    - conftest.py: Shared fixtures for workflow tests
    - test_workflow_*.py: Individual test modules for scenarios A0-A6

Design Principles:
    - No real infrastructure: All external dependencies are mocked
    - Call count tracking: Mocks track invocations for purity verification
    - Deterministic time: DeterministicClock enables time control
    - Snapshot normalization: Helpers for reproducible test output
    - Correlation ID tracing: All fixtures support correlation tracking

Available Fixtures (from conftest.py):
    Clock & UUID:
        - deterministic_clock: DeterministicClock for time control
        - uuid_generator: DeterministicUUIDGenerator for reproducible UUIDs
        - correlation_id: Pre-generated deterministic correlation ID

    Mock Effects (with call tracking):
        - mock_consul_effect: MockConsulEffect with failure injection
        - mock_postgres_effect: MockPostgresEffect with failure injection
        - registry_effect_with_mocks: NodeRegistryEffect wired with mocks

    Component Fixtures:
        - registration_reducer: RegistrationReducer instance
        - initial_state: ModelRegistrationState in idle status
        - tracked_reducer: TrackedRegistrationReducer for call tracking
        - tracked_effect: TrackedNodeRegistryEffect for call tracking
        - call_tracker: CallOrderTracker for verifying execution order

    Event Factories:
        - introspection_event_factory: Creates random introspection events
        - deterministic_introspection_event_factory: Deterministic events
        - registry_request_factory: Creates registry requests

    Observability:
        - caplog: Use pytest's built-in caplog fixture for log capture

    Test Helpers:
        - snapshot_normalizer: SnapshotNormalizer for stable assertions
        - workflow_context: WorkflowScenarioContext with all components
        - failure_injector: FailureInjector for setting up failure scenarios
