"""Integration tests A3 and A4 for OMN-915 mocked E2E registration workflow.

These tests verify the orchestrated registration workflow with ZERO real
infrastructure, using test doubles for all backends.

Test Scenarios:
    A3 - Orchestrated Dual Registration:
        - Orchestrator receives introspection event
        - Reducer computes intents (NO I/O)
        - Effect executes intents (DOES I/O via mocks)
        - Results aggregated correctly
        - Verifies reducer called BEFORE effect

    A4 - Idempotent Replay:
        - First emission processes event
        - Replay same event (same event_id, correlation_id)
        - Logical state identical
        - No duplicate Postgres rows
        - Effect idempotency store tracks completed backends

Design Principles:
    - ZERO real infrastructure: All backends are test doubles
    - Call order tracking: Verifies orchestration order
    - State comparison: Verifies idempotency
    - Mocked backends: Uses StubConsulClient and StubPostgresAdapter

Related:
    - RegistrationReducer: Pure reducer for intent computation
    - NodeRegistryEffect: Effect for backend registration execution
    - NodeRegistrationOrchestrator: Workflow coordinator (contract-driven)
