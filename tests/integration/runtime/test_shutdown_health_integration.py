"""Integration tests for shutdown and health check interaction.

Tests the interaction between RuntimeHostProcess shutdown lifecycle and
health check behavior. These tests verify:

1. Health check behavior during shutdown
2. Health check behavior after shutdown
3. Health server HTTP responses during runtime shutdown
4. Graceful shutdown sequence with no errors
