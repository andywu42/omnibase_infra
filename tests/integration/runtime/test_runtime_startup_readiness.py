"""Integration tests for runtime startup readiness (OMN-2081).

Tests that the ONEX runtime reaches a ready state in under 10 seconds
using the in-memory event bus. These tests verify:

1. Runtime reaches healthy/ready state within the 10-second SLA
2. Health HTTP endpoint returns 200 when runtime is ready
3. Readiness check includes event bus health details
