"""Shared pytest configuration for all performance tests.

This conftest.py automatically applies the `performance` marker to all tests
in the tests/performance/ directory hierarchy, providing consistent test
categorization without requiring individual files to set pytestmark.

Marker Application:
    All tests under tests/performance/** are automatically marked with:
    - pytest.mark.performance

    NOTE: pytestmark at module-level in conftest.py does NOT automatically
    apply to tests in other files. We use pytest_collection_modifyitems hook
    instead to dynamically mark all tests in the performance directory.

This enables selective test execution:
    # Run only performance tests
    pytest -m performance

    # Run all except performance tests
    pytest -m "not performance"

    This hook runs after test collection and adds the 'performance' marker to any
