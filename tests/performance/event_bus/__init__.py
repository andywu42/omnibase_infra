"""Performance tests for Event Bus implementations.

This package contains performance and benchmark tests for:
- EventBusInmemory throughput and latency
- Concurrent publisher/subscriber performance
- Load testing and memory stability

Test Categories:
    - Throughput: Messages per second benchmarks
    - Latency: p50, p95, p99 latency measurements
    - Load: Sustained high-volume testing
