"""Throughput performance tests for Event Bus.

This test suite measures event throughput characteristics including:
- Messages per second for publish operations
- Batch publishing performance
- Concurrent publisher throughput
- Subscriber delivery throughput

Performance Thresholds:
    These thresholds are intentionally lenient for CI environments
    where resources may be constrained. Adjust for dedicated perf testing.

    - Single publisher: > 1000 events/sec
    - Batch publishing: > 5000 events/sec
    - Concurrent publishers: > 2000 events/sec total

CI Behavior:
    Some tests in this module are automatically skipped in CI environments
    (detected via CI or GITHUB_ACTIONS environment variables). These tests
    have high absolute throughput thresholds (e.g., >5000 events/sec) that
    may not be achievable on shared CI runners with variable resources.

    Skipped in CI:
        - test_10000_sequential_publishes (5000 events/sec threshold)
        - test_batch_publish_1000_messages (5000 events/sec threshold)
        - test_50_concurrent_publishers (5000 events/sec aggregate threshold)
        - test_concurrent_multi_topic (3000 events/sec multi-topic threshold)

    These tests run locally and provide value for detecting performance
    regressions during development.

Usage:
    Run throughput tests locally:
        uv run pytest tests/performance/event_bus/test_event_bus_throughput.py -v

    Force-skip performance tests (marker-based):
        uv run pytest -m "not performance" tests/
