"""Latency performance tests for Event Bus.

This test suite measures latency characteristics including:
- Publish operation latency (p50, p95, p99)
- End-to-end message delivery latency
- Latency under varying load conditions
- Latency distribution analysis

Performance Thresholds:
    Target latencies are intentionally lenient for CI environments.
    Adjust for dedicated performance testing infrastructure.

    - Publish p95: < 100ms
    - End-to-end p95: < 100ms
    - Publish p99: < 200ms

CI Behavior:
    Some tests in this module are automatically skipped in CI environments
    (detected via CI or GITHUB_ACTIONS environment variables). These tests
    use relative performance comparisons (ratios, degradation factors) that
    are highly sensitive to resource contention on shared CI runners.

    Skipped in CI:
        - test_cold_vs_warm_publish_latency (cold/warm ratio check)
        - test_publish_latency_with_headers (header overhead ratio)
        - test_e2e_latency_with_multiple_subscribers (subscriber latency ratio)
        - test_latency_consistency_over_time (degradation factor)

    These tests run locally and provide value for detecting performance
    regressions during development.

Usage:
    Run latency tests locally:
        uv run pytest tests/performance/event_bus/test_event_bus_latency.py -v

    Force-skip performance tests (marker-based):
        uv run pytest -m "not performance" tests/
