"""Backpressure and overload tests for Event Bus.

This test suite validates event bus behavior when producers outpace consumers,
and under various overload conditions. Tests cover:

- Slow consumer / fast producer scenarios (backpressure)
- Queue depth behavior under overload
- Circuit breaker activation under sustained failure load
- Graceful degradation when consumers are overwhelmed
- Recovery after overload conditions subside
- Memory bounds under sustained overload

Design Rationale:
    The in-memory event bus delivers synchronously: publish() awaits each
    subscriber before returning. This means backpressure manifests as
    increased publish latency (producer slows to match consumer speed),
    rather than queue growth. Tests validate that:

    1. Slow consumers slow down publishers proportionally
    2. Latency degrades gracefully (not catastrophically)
    3. No messages are dropped or lost
    4. Circuit breakers activate on sustained failures
    5. Memory stays bounded even under overload

CI Behavior:
    Tests with strict latency thresholds are skipped in CI due to variable
    CPU resources on shared runners. Tests that only check correctness
    (no message loss, circuit breaker activation) run in all environments.

Usage:
    Run backpressure tests:
        uv run pytest tests/performance/event_bus/test_event_bus_backpressure.py -v

    Skip performance tests:
        uv run pytest -m "not performance" tests/
