"""Architecture compliance tests for ONEX infrastructure.  # ai-slop-ok: pre-existing

These tests verify that architectural boundaries are maintained between
omnibase_core (pure, no I/O) and omnibase_infra (infrastructure, owns all I/O).

The core principle: omnibase_core must not contain any infrastructure-specific
imports such as kafka, httpx, or asyncpg. These belong exclusively in omnibase_infra.

Ticket: OMN-255

CI Integration  # ai-slop-ok: pre-existing
==============

These tests run as part of the CI pipeline in two ways:

1. **Pre-push hook** (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`):
   - Hook ID: `onex-validate-architecture-layers`
   - Stage: `pre-push` (not pre-commit for performance)
   - Runs: `uv run python scripts/validate.py architecture_layers`

2. **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):
   - Job: `onex-validation` ("ONEX Validators")
   - Runs: `uv run python scripts/validate.py all --verbose`
   - Includes architecture_layers as part of the full validation suite

Detection Capabilities  # ai-slop-ok: pre-existing
======================

**This Python test file** uses line-by-line regex scanning which detects:
- Top-level imports: `import kafka`, `from kafka import X`
- Inline imports inside functions/methods (indented imports ARE detected)
- Imports with submodules: `import kafka.producer`, `from kafka.consumer import X`
- Imports inside class bodies

Example - ALL of these ARE detected by this Python scanner::

    import kafka                      # Top-level - DETECTED
    from kafka import Producer        # Top-level - DETECTED

    def my_function():
        import kafka                  # Inline/indented - DETECTED
        from httpx import Client      # Inline/indented - DETECTED

    class MyClass:
        from asyncpg import connect   # Class body - DETECTED

**Limitations of this Python scanner:**
- Imports constructed dynamically (`__import__()`, `importlib.import_module()`)
- String-based import references in configuration files
- Imports inside `exec()` or `eval()` calls
- Multi-line import statements (e.g., imports wrapped with parentheses over multiple lines)
- Imports aliased through variables (e.g., `mod = __import__("kafka"); mod.Producer`)

**Docstring Detection Caveats:**
- Multiline strings are tracked by delimiter type (triple-single vs triple-double)
- Nested delimiters inside strings are correctly ignored (e.g., triple-single inside triple-double)
- Unclosed multiline strings at EOF are handled gracefully (content treated as inside string)
- String prefixes (r, f, b, u, rf, fr, rb, br) are recognized and handled
- Edge case: imports on the same line after a closing delimiter ARE detected

Multiline String State Machine
==============================

The scanner uses a state machine to track whether the current line is inside a
multiline string (docstring). This is necessary because import statements inside
docstrings should not be flagged as violations.

**State Variables:**

- ``in_multiline_string`` (bool): Whether currently inside a multiline string
- ``multiline_delimiter`` (str | None): The delimiter type (triple-single or triple-double) if inside

**State Transitions:**

1. **NOT in multiline -> Line has unbalanced delimiter:**

   - Find first triple-quote delimiter on line
   - If odd count of that delimiter -> enter multiline, save delimiter type
   - Content before the opening delimiter is checked for imports

2. **IN multiline -> Line has closing delimiter:**

   - Find closing delimiter matching saved type
   - Exit multiline state
   - Content after the closing delimiter is checked for imports
   - If remainder has another unbalanced delimiter -> enter new multiline

3. **IN multiline -> Line has NO closing delimiter:**

   - Stay in multiline state
   - Entire line is skipped (no import checking)

**Handling Nested Delimiters:**

The tricky case is when one delimiter type appears inside another.
For example: triple-single This docstring contains triple-double inside triple-single

The scanner handles this by:

1. Finding which delimiter type appears FIRST on the line
2. Checking if that type is "balanced" (even count = opens and closes on same line)
3. Only considering the OTHER delimiter type if it appears OUTSIDE balanced strings

**Key Functions:**

- ``_find_first_unquoted_delimiter()``: Find first triple-quote that starts a string
- ``_is_balanced_string_line()``: Check if a delimiter type has even count
- ``_find_delimiter_outside_balanced()``: Find delimiters not inside other strings
- ``_count_delimiter_outside_balanced()``: Count delimiters outside balanced strings
- ``_find_multiline_state_after_line()``: Main state transition function

**Edge Cases Handled:**

- Opening and closing on same line: triple-double docstring triple-double (balanced, not multiline)
- Multiple strings on one line: triple-double first triple-double triple-double second triple-double
- Delimiter inside other type: triple-single contains triple-double inside triple-single
- Code after closing: triple-double docstring triple-double import kafka (import IS detected)
- Empty multiline: Just triple-double on its own line
- Unclosed at EOF: Treated as inside string (graceful degradation)

**Known Limitations:**

- Raw strings with escaped delimiters may confuse the parser in rare cases
- Extremely complex nesting patterns (3+ levels) are not explicitly tested
- String concatenation across lines is not handled (e.g., "foo" "bar")

Tool Comparison
===============

**Bash script** (`scripts/check_architecture.sh`) has MORE limitations:
- Cannot reliably distinguish real imports from mentions in comments/docstrings
- Cannot parse multiline docstrings (may produce false positives)
- Cannot detect TYPE_CHECKING blocks (may flag type-only imports)
- Has no context awareness (line-by-line grep matching)

Note: The bash script CAN find indented imports (grep does pattern matching), but
it cannot distinguish them from import statements mentioned in docstrings or comments.
This leads to potential false positives that this Python scanner avoids.

The bash script is designed for quick CI checks with JSON output support.
This Python test file provides more thorough analysis with:
- Proper multiline docstring handling (no false positives from examples)
- TYPE_CHECKING block awareness (type-only imports allowed)
- Context-aware detection (distinguishes real imports from documentation)

For comprehensive detection with zero false positives, prefer this Python test file:
    pytest tests/ci/test_architecture_compliance.py

        Known Violations
        ----------------
        Violations for patterns in KNOWN_VIOLATION_PATTERNS are filtered out

        Resource Constraints

        omnibase_core, parses them, and checks for forbidden import patterns.
        When run in parallel with pytest-xdist, it can crash CI workers due to
        memory pressure from multiple workers running similar scans concurrently.
