"""Deterministic test utilities for predictable testing.  # ai-slop-ok: pre-existing

This module provides utilities that generate deterministic values for testing,
enabling reproducible test behavior and eliminating flakiness from random
UUID generation or time-dependent logic.

Example usage:
    >>> from tests.helpers.deterministic import (
    ...     DeterministicIdGenerator, DeterministicClock
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Predictable UUID generation
    >>> id_gen = DeterministicIdGenerator(seed=100)
    >>> uuid1 = id_gen.next_uuid()
    >>> uuid2 = id_gen.next_uuid()
    >>> assert uuid1 != uuid2  # Different UUIDs
    >>> assert uuid1 == UUID(int=101)  # Predictable value
    >>>
    >>> # Controllable time
    >>> clock = DeterministicClock()
    >>> t1 = clock.now()
    >>> clock.advance(60)
    >>> t2 = clock.now()
    >>> assert (t2 - t1).total_seconds() == 60

    This class provides deterministic UUID generation based on an incrementing
    counter, enabling reproducible test assertions on generated identifiers.

    The generated UUIDs are valid UUID objects created from integer values,
    making them suitable for database operations and API responses.

    Attributes:
        _counter: Internal counter used to generate sequential UUID values.

    Example:
        >>> gen = DeterministicIdGenerator(seed=0)
        >>> gen.next_uuid()
        UUID('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001')
