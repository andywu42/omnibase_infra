"""Restart recovery tests for OMN-955.

This test suite validates that workflows correctly resume after a process restart.
It tests the critical guarantee that:

1. Workflow progress is tracked via idempotency store
2. After restart, already-completed steps are skipped
3. Workflow resumes from the correct point
4. No duplicate side effects occur on restart

Architecture:
    The Effect layer uses an idempotency store (InMemory for tests, PostgreSQL
    in production) to track which intents have been processed. On restart:

    1. Effect executor initializes with same idempotency store
    2. When processing pending intents, store is checked first
    3. Already-processed intents are skipped (no I/O)
    4. New intents are processed and recorded

Test Organization:
    - TestRestartMidWorkflow: Restart during multi-step workflow
    - TestResumeFromCorrectPoint: Verify resume position
    - TestNoExtraIO: Confirm no duplicate side effects

class SimulatedEffectExecutor:

    This class represents the essential idempotency logic that an Effect node

    2. Execute backend operation if not duplicate
    3. Record execution in idempotency store
