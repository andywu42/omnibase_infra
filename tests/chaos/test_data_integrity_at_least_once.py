"""At-Least-Once Delivery Tests Under Chaos Conditions (OMN-955).

This test suite validates that the system provides at-least-once delivery
guarantees even under chaotic conditions such as:

1. Random processing failures
2. Transient errors during execution
3. Process restarts mid-processing
4. Retry exhaustion scenarios

At-Least-Once Semantics:
    Every event submitted to the system will eventually be processed
    successfully, even if multiple attempts are required. Combined with
    idempotency (OMN-954), this ensures exactly-once semantics.

Architecture:
    The chaos injection pattern uses configurable failure rates to simulate
    transient failures during event processing. The test validates that:
    - All events are eventually processed (completeness)
    - Failed events are properly retried (retry mechanism)
    - No events are lost during processing (durability)

Test Strategy:
    - Use mock executors with controllable failure injection
    - Track all submitted events and verify all are eventually processed
    - Validate retry logic properly handles transient failures
    - Ensure no data loss even under high failure rates
