"""Chaos tests for network partition scenarios (OMN-955).

This test suite validates system behavior during network partitions and
connectivity issues. It covers:

1. Event bus connection drop simulation
2. Kafka/message broker disconnect scenarios
3. Reconnection behavior after partition heals
4. Message delivery guarantees during partitions

Architecture:
    Network partitions can occur at various points:

    1. Producer-side partition: Publisher cannot reach broker
    2. Consumer-side partition: Subscriber cannot receive messages
    3. Broker partition: Broker is unreachable by all clients
    4. Split-brain: Some clients can reach broker, others cannot

    The system should:
    - Detect partitions quickly
    - Buffer messages when possible
    - Reconnect automatically when partition heals
    - Preserve message order and delivery guarantees

Test Organization:
    - TestEventBusConnectionDrop: Connection drop scenarios
    - TestPartitionDuringPublish: Partition during message publish
    - TestPartitionDuringConsume: Partition during message consumption
    - TestPartitionHealing: Reconnection after partition heals
