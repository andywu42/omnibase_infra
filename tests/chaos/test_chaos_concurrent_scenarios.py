"""Chaos tests for concurrent failure scenarios (OMN-955).

This test suite validates system behavior when multiple failure modes occur
simultaneously. It covers:

1. Multiple services failing at the same time (database + cache + API)
2. Cascading failures where one failure triggers another
3. Race condition handling during concurrent chaotic operations
4. Mixed failure modes (timeouts + connection errors + partial failures)

Architecture:
    Concurrent chaos scenarios are particularly challenging because:

    1. Multiple failure modes can interact in unexpected ways
    2. Race conditions can expose hidden bugs in error handling
    3. Circuit breakers may trip across multiple services simultaneously
    4. Rollback logic must handle multiple partial failures

    The system should:
    - Handle multiple simultaneous failures gracefully
    - Properly track failure counts across concurrent operations
    - Maintain data integrity during concurrent chaos
    - Not deadlock or hang under failure conditions

Test Organization:
    - TestConcurrentMultiServiceFailures: Multiple services failing together
    - TestCascadingFailures: Failure propagation chains
    - TestRaceConditionHandling: Concurrent operations with chaos
    - TestMixedFailureModes: Combining different failure types
