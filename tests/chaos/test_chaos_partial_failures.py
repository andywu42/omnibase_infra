"""Chaos tests for partial failure scenarios (OMN-955).

This test suite validates system behavior when some effects succeed and
others fail. It covers:

1. Scenarios where some effects in a workflow succeed, others fail
2. Partial execution rollback behavior
3. Tracking of partial failures
4. Recovery strategies for partial failures

Architecture:
    Partial failures occur when a workflow has multiple effects and some
    fail while others succeed:

    1. First effect succeeds (e.g., Consul registration)
    2. Second effect fails (e.g., PostgreSQL upsert)
    3. Third effect never runs (workflow aborted)

    The system should:
    - Track which effects succeeded/failed
    - Support compensation/rollback for completed effects
    - Allow selective retry of failed effects
    - Maintain consistency through saga pattern

Test Organization:
    - TestPartialExecutionTracking: Track partial success/failure
    - TestPartialRollback: Rollback behavior for completed effects
    - TestPartialRecovery: Recovery strategies for partial failures
    - TestPartialFailureWithIdempotency: Idempotency in partial scenarios
