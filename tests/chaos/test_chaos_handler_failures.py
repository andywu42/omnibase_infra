"""Chaos tests for handler failures (OMN-955).

This test suite validates system behavior when handlers fail at various points
during execution. It covers:

1. Random failures during handler processing
2. Failure at different execution points (pre, mid, post)
3. Failure propagation and error handling
4. Recovery behavior after handler failures

Architecture:
    Handlers are the units of work that process messages. When a handler fails:

    1. The failure should be properly propagated
    2. The idempotency system should track incomplete executions
    3. Retry mechanisms should be able to re-attempt the operation
    4. Circuit breakers should protect against cascading failures

Test Organization:
    - TestHandlerFailureAtVariousPoints: Failures at pre/mid/post execution
    - TestHandlerFailurePropagation: Error propagation behavior
    - TestHandlerFailureRecovery: Recovery after failures
    - TestHandlerFailureRandom: Random failure injection
