"""Race condition tests for MixinAsyncCircuitBreaker.  # ai-slop-ok: pre-existing

This module provides comprehensive async race condition tests for:
- Concurrent circuit breaker state checks
- Concurrent failure recording
- Concurrent reset operations
- State transitions under concurrent load
- HALF_OPEN state race conditions

These tests verify that the circuit breaker mixin properly handles
concurrent access patterns that would occur in production systems.

Test Design Notes:
    - All tests use asyncio.gather() for true concurrent execution
    - Tests use deterministic assertions that account for valid race outcomes
      (e.g., "circuit is open OR we observed InfraUnavailableError")
    - Tests with timing dependencies use long reset_timeouts (60s) to ensure
      deterministic state (no auto-transitions during test execution)
    - Lock-based synchronization ensures correct state access patterns

Reliability:
    These tests are designed to be deterministic and CI-stable through:
    - Avoiding timing-based assertions that depend on execution speed
    - Using long reset_timeouts where state must remain stable during assertions
    - Accepting all valid concurrent execution outcomes (race-condition-aware)
    - Using explicit synchronization for shared state access
