"""Adversarial tests: fingerprint drift detection (CI twin validation) [OMN-2293].

These tests prove the CI twin fingerprint system is NOT cosmetic by
intentionally introducing drift and asserting the twin correctly catches it.

Design rationale:
    "Trust but verify" — any safety mechanism must itself be tested by
    attempting to defeat it. If these tests pass, the twin system provably
    catches the specific drift scenarios that caused the Feb 15 incident class.

Two systems are validated:
    1. Schema fingerprint twin (check_schema_fingerprint.py)
       Detects when forward migration SQL files change without the artifact
       being regenerated (docker/migrations/schema_fingerprint.sha256).

    2. Event registry fingerprint twin (check_event_registry_fingerprint.py)
       Detects when ALL_EVENT_REGISTRATIONS changes without the artifact
       being regenerated (event_registry_fingerprint.json).

Each test follows the pattern:
    1. Stamp a valid artifact against the current state
    2. Mutate the source (schema file or registry)
    3. Do NOT re-stamp
    4. Run the CI twin verify step
    5. Assert: exit code == 2 (FAILED) with clear diagnostics

        It does NOT re-validate individual element_sha256 fields from the artifact

        Therefore: if you corrupt an individual element_sha256 in the JSON artifact
