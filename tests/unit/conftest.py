"""Shared pytest configuration for all unit tests.

This conftest.py automatically applies the `unit` marker to all tests
in the tests/unit/ directory hierarchy, providing consistent test
categorization without requiring individual files to set pytestmark.

Marker Application:
    All tests under tests/unit/** are automatically marked with:
    - pytest.mark.unit

    NOTE: pytestmark at module-level in conftest.py does NOT automatically
    apply to tests in other files. We use pytest_collection_modifyitems hook
    instead to dynamically mark all tests in the unit directory.

This enables selective test execution:
    # Run only unit tests
    pytest -m unit

    # Run all except unit tests
    pytest -m "not unit"
