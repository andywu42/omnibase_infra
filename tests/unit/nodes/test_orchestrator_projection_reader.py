"""Unit tests for projection reader interactions (OMN-952).

These tests verify that the NodeRegistrationOrchestrator uses projection
reader for state decisions rather than direct topic scanning. Per OMN-930,
state should be read through ProtocolProjectionReader, not by consuming
Kafka topics directly.

The projection reader pattern ensures:
1. State decisions are based on materialized projections (consistent views)
2. No direct topic consumption for state reading (avoids race conditions)
3. Proper dependency injection of projection reader protocol
4. Clear dependency chain: receive_introspection -> read_projection -> evaluate_timeout

- OMN-952: Comprehensive orchestrator tests including projection reader validation
- OMN-973: Time injection for timeout evaluation (depends on projection state)
