"""Performance regression tests for RegistrationReducer [OMN-1258].

This test suite validates that the RegistrationReducer meets its documented
performance thresholds:

    - reduce() processing: <300ms per event (target)
    - Intent building: <50ms per intent (PostgreSQL only)
    - Idempotency check: <1ms

These tests use safety margins (typically 50% of threshold) to account for:
    - CI environment variance
    - GC pauses
    - Resource contention

The tests are marked with @pytest.mark.performance for selective execution.
Run with: pytest -m performance

# Two timestamp approaches are used in this test suite:
#
# 1. TEST_TIMESTAMP (fixed): Used in fixtures (e.g., sample_event) for tests
#    that measure single operations or reuse the same event. Provides
#    deterministic behavior and consistent test data.
#
# 2. datetime.now(UTC) (dynamic): Used in iteration-based tests where fresh
#    events are created per iteration. While UUIDs provide primary uniqueness,
#    dynamic timestamps ensure events are temporally distinct and reflect
#    realistic scenarios.
#
# The choice depends on whether test determinism or realistic event freshness
# is more important for the specific performance measurement.
