"""Reducer Purity Enforcement Gates.

These tests make reducer purity violations IMPOSSIBLE, not just discouraged.
If the same introspection event is replayed tomorrow, next week, or after a crash:
- Reducer emits the same intents
- Effects converge to the same external state
- Observed outcome is identical

If this is not true, the system is broken.
