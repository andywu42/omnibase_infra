"""RED tests for ARCH-003: No Workflow FSM in Orchestrators.

These tests should FAIL initially (RED phase of TDD).
They verify that orchestrators with workflow FSM logic are detected.

KEY CLARIFICATION from ticket OMN-1099:
    - Reducers MAY implement aggregate state machines (that's their purpose)
    - Orchestrators must NOT implement workflow FSMs duplicating reducer transitions
    - Orchestrators are "reaction planners", not state machine owners

Rule ARCH-003 Scope:
    This rule targets orchestrator code that:
    1. Defines state transition tables (STATES, TRANSITIONS class variables)
    2. Tracks workflow state internally (_state, _workflow_state, _current_step)
    3. Implements transition methods (transition, can_transition, apply_transition)

    This rule does NOT apply to:
    1. Reducers (which legitimately own state machines)
    2. Orchestrators without FSM logic (pure coordination)
    3. Orchestrators that delegate state to reducers

Running Tests:
    # Run all ARCH-003 tests:
    pytest tests/unit/nodes/node_architecture_validator/test_validator_no_orchestrator_fsm.py -v

    # Run specific test:
    pytest tests/unit/nodes/node_architecture_validator/test_validator_no_orchestrator_fsm.py::TestNoOrchestratorFSM::test_detects_state_machine_in_orchestrator -v

Expected Outcome (RED Phase):
    These tests should FAIL because the stub validator always returns valid=True.
    The GREEN phase will implement actual FSM detection logic.
