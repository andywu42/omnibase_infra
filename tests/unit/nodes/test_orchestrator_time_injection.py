"""Tests verifying orchestrator uses injected `now`, not system clock.

These tests ensure the NodeRegistrationOrchestrator follows ONEX time injection
rules by:
1. NOT calling datetime.now() or datetime.utcnow() in node.py
2. NOT calling time.time() or time.monotonic() in node.py
3. Declaring time_injection configuration in contract.yaml
4. Using "RuntimeTick" as the time injection source
5. Configuring the evaluate_timeout step with time_injection: true
6. Consuming RuntimeTick events for time-based operations

Ticket: OMN-952
Related: OMN-973 (DispatchContextEnforcer implementation)

ONEX Architecture Constraint:
    Orchestrators receive `now` from the dispatch context (via DispatchContextEnforcer),
    NOT from system clock calls. This ensures:
    - Testability: Time can be injected in tests for deterministic behavior
    - Consistency: All time-dependent decisions use the same dispatch-time timestamp
    - Replay safety: Event replay doesn't produce different results due to clock drift

Design Pattern:
    The DispatchContextEnforcer creates ModelDispatchContext with `now` for orchestrators
    at dispatch time. The orchestrator receives this injected time and uses it for
    all time-dependent operations (timeout evaluation, deadline calculation, etc.).

# Time-Dependency Detection
# =============================================================================
# This module uses keyword-based heuristics to identify workflow steps that
# likely perform time-dependent operations. These steps should declare
# `time_injection: true` in their step_config.
#
# Detection Strategy:
#   1. Pattern matching with word boundaries to avoid substring false positives
#   2. Partial word stems (e.g., "expir", "schedul") to catch variations
#   3. Exclusion list for known false positives (async patterns, etc.)
#   4. Check step_config for time-related keys as secondary indicator
#
# Known Limitations:
#   - May miss custom time-related operations with non-standard naming
#   - Domain-specific time concepts may require additions to patterns
#   - Heuristic approach cannot guarantee 100% accuracy
#
# To add new patterns: Add regex to TIME_KEYWORD_PATTERNS
# To exclude false positives: Add node_id to TIME_KEYWORD_EXCEPTIONS

# Regex patterns that suggest time-dependent operations.
# Uses word boundaries (\b) where appropriate to avoid substring matches.
