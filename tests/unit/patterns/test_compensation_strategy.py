"""Unit tests for compensation strategy patterns.

Tests cover:
- Partial failure detection (some operations succeed, some fail)
- Compensation action invocation for failed I/O operations
- Domain events are NOT rolled back (verify they persist)
- Compensation creates compensating events instead of rollback

The compensation pattern follows these principles:
1. I/O operations (database writes, API calls) can be compensated
2. Domain events are NEVER rolled back - they are immutable records
3. Compensation creates new compensating events (e.g., OrderCancelled for OrderCreated)
4. Partial success is explicitly handled with recorded state

This pattern is documented in CLAUDE.md under "Error Recovery Patterns"
and "Compensation Strategy" sections.
