"""CI drift guard: contract YAML topics vs ALL_PLATFORM_TOPIC_SPECS registry.

Ensures that every platform topic declared in the orchestrator contract YAML
appears in ALL_PLATFORM_TOPIC_SPECS (or is a known consumer-only topic that
does not need provisioning by TopicProvisioner).

If this test fails, it means a new platform topic was added to the contract
but not registered in platform_topic_suffixes.py, or vice versa. This catches
contract / registry drift before it reaches production.
