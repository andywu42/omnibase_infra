Test Isolation and Cleanup Patterns
====================================

This test suite demonstrates proper test isolation patterns for async tests:

1. **Cleanup Order**: Always call `await bus.close()` inside the patch context
   to ensure mocks are still active during cleanup. This prevents AttributeError
   during producer.stop() calls.

2. **Exception Handling**: Tests that simulate failures properly catch and
   suppress expected exceptions using try/except blocks with pass statements.

3. **Timing-Sensitive Tests**: Tests using asyncio.sleep() include documentation
   noting that timing may vary under system load. These tests verify thread
   safety, not strict timing behavior.

4. **Resource Management**: Each test creates its own bus instance and ensures
   cleanup within the test method, preventing resource leaks between tests.

5. **Idempotency Testing**: Tests like concurrent_close_operations verify that
   operations can be safely called multiple times without additional cleanup.

6. **Documentation**: Inline comments explain cleanup patterns and expected
   behaviors to aid future maintenance and parallel test execution.

These patterns ensure tests can run reliably in parallel (pytest-xdist) without
interference or resource contention.
