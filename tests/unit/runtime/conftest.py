"""Shared pytest fixtures for runtime unit tests.

This conftest.py provides fixtures commonly used across runtime tests,
consolidating shared mocks to avoid code duplication.

Fixtures:
    mock_wire_infrastructure: Mocks wire_infrastructure_services and
        ModelONEXContainer to avoid wiring errors in tests.
    mock_runtime_handler: Auto-discovered from root tests/conftest.py via
        pytest's conftest hierarchy (not re-exported here).

Functions:
    seed_mock_handlers: Imported from tests.helpers.runtime_helpers for
        fail-fast bypass in RuntimeHostProcess tests.

    This fixture uses the ONEX_EVENT_BUS_TYPE environment variable override
    mechanism (documented in runtime_config.yaml) to force inmemory event bus.
    This is more robust than patching load_runtime_config because:
    1. It uses the documented environment variable override mechanism
    2. The kernel explicitly checks ONEX_EVENT_BUS_TYPE before config.event_bus.type
    3. It doesn't rely on patch timing

    The default runtime_config.yaml has event_bus.type='kafka', which requires
    KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS env var. For unit tests that don't test Kafka
    specifically, we use ONEX_EVENT_BUS_TYPE=inmemory to bypass this.

    Yields:
        MagicMock (for backwards compatibility with tests expecting a MagicMock).
