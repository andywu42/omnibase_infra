"""Performance benchmarks for policy_registry module.  # ai-slop-ok: pre-existing

This module contains performance tests to verify the optimization work
done to reduce redundant operations in the RegistryPolicy.get() method.

Key optimizations tested:
1. Secondary index for O(1) policy_id lookup (vs O(n) scan)
2. Early exit when policy_id not found
3. Deferred error message generation (expensive _list_internal() calls)
4. Fast path when no filtering needed
5. Cached semver parsing with LRU cache
