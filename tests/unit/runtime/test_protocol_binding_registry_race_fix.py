"""Test for RegistryProtocolBinding.get() race condition fix (PR #129).

This module specifically tests the race condition that was fixed where:
1. Thread A acquires lock, checks handler_cls is None, releases lock
2. Thread B registers the protocol between lock release and error raise
3. Thread A raises RegistryError claiming protocol isn't registered (but it now is)

The fix moves the None check inside the lock context to ensure atomicity.
