"""Out-of-Order Event Tests for OMN-955.

This module tests replay behavior with out-of-order event arrival and
validates that ordering issues are detected and handled correctly.

Out-of-Order Scenarios:
    1. Events arriving with non-sequential timestamps
    2. Events being replayed in different order than original
    3. Sequence number violations in event logs
    4. Interleaved events from multiple sources

Test Coverage:
    - Detection of out-of-order events
    - Handling of sequence violations
    - Impact of event ordering on final state
    - Recovery from ordering anomalies

Architecture:
    The RegistrationReducer is stateless per invocation - each call to
    reduce() receives the full state and returns new state. This means:

    - Event ordering doesn't affect individual reductions
    - The orchestrator/runtime is responsible for event ordering
    - The reducer can detect redelivered events via last_processed_event_id
    - Timestamp ordering is informational, not enforced by reducer

    This test module validates the infrastructure's ability to detect
    and handle ordering issues at the application layer.
