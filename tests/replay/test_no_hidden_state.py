"""No Hidden State Validation Tests for OMN-955.

These tests prove that the RegistrationReducer has NO hidden mutable state
outside the event stream. This is a fundamental ONEX pure reducer guarantee:

    All state changes MUST be visible through the event stream.
    The reducer has NO side effects beyond returning the new state.

Architecture Validation:
    - Reducer is a pure function: reduce(state, event) -> output
    - No instance variables mutated during reduce()
    - No class variables mutated during reduce()
    - No global state affected by reduce()
    - No external resources accessed during reduce()

Enforcement Strategy:
    1. Structural inspection via inspect module (method signatures, attributes)
    2. Runtime monitoring (mocking I/O operations)
    3. State isolation tests (parallel execution with shared reducer)
    4. Determinism verification (same input -> same output always)
