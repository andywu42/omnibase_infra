"""Event Sequence Capture Tests for OMN-955.

This module tests the ability to capture event sequences from registration
workflows for later replay verification. Event sequences are the foundation
of replay testing - they record the events and expected outcomes that can
be replayed to verify reducer determinism.

Test Coverage:
    - Capturing events from registration workflows
    - Creating event log fixtures
    - Serializing and deserializing event sequences
    - Validating sequence integrity

Architecture:
    Event sequences capture the following for each event:
    1. The event itself (ModelNodeIntrospectionEvent)
    2. Expected state status after processing
    3. Expected intent count
    4. Sequence number for ordering

    These sequences enable:
    - Determinism testing (replay produces same output)
    - Idempotency testing (duplicate events are skipped)
    - Out-of-order detection (sequence violations are caught)
