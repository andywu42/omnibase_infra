"""Idempotent Replay Tests for OMN-955.

This module verifies that idempotent replay produces consistent results.
Idempotency ensures that replaying the same events multiple times
yields identical final state without side effects.

Idempotency Guarantees:
    1. Same event processed multiple times = same final state
    2. Duplicate events emit no additional intents
    3. Replay count doesn't affect final state
    4. Event ID (correlation_id) is used for deduplication

Test Coverage:
    - Single event idempotency
    - Multi-replay idempotency
    - Sequence replay idempotency
    - Crash recovery scenarios
    - Intent emission on replays

Architecture:
    The RegistrationReducer implements idempotency via last_processed_event_id:

    1. Each event has a unique event_id (correlation_id or derived)
    2. After processing, state.last_processed_event_id is updated
    3. On replay, state.is_duplicate_event(event_id) returns True
    4. Duplicate events return current state unchanged with no intents

    This enables safe replay after crashes or network issues:
    - If crash occurs after state update but before Kafka ack
    - Event is redelivered
    - Reducer detects duplicate and skips
    - No duplicate intents are emitted
